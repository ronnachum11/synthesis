        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron hit Donald Trump with his biggest punishment to date on Friday, in a ruling that fined the former president $355 million for fraudulently inflating the values of his properties.\n\nCombined with the $83 million judgment issued against Trump for defaming E. Jean Carroll, that means Trump has been fined roughly $438 million over the past four weeks.\n\nFriday\u2019s ruling underscored how the civil cases against Trump are still significantly damaging to the former president, endangering his business empire even as he faces four criminal trials, the first of which is set to begin next month.\n\nEngoron found Trump liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false financial statements and false business records, and he barred him from serving as director of a company in New York for three years. But while he stopped short of dissolving the Trump Organization altogether, Engoron issued a blistering 93-page opinion that painted the former president as unremorseful and highly likely to commit fraud again.\n\n\u201cTheir complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,\u201d Engoron wrote of Trump and his co-defendants.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know from the decision:\n\nEngoron\u2019s fines are the biggest yet against Trump\n\nThe fines Engoron levied in his ruling against Trump \u2013 known as \u201cdisgorgement,\u201d or the return of ill-gotten gains \u2013 are higher in terms of magnitude than any previous fine levied against the former president and his company.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James had asked Engoron to fine Trump and other defendants $370 million, accusing them of engaging in a long-running fraud scheme of inflating Trump\u2019s assets on his financial statements.\n\nIt came pretty close. Engoron found that the defendants\u2019 fraud saved them about $168 million in interest, fining Trump and his companies that amount.\n\nEngoron ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $126 million in ill-gotten profits from the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, DC, a contract the judge says \u201cwas obtained through the use of false SFC (statements of financial condition).\u201d\n\nAnd the judge ruled that Trump and his companies were liable for $60 million in profits from the sale of Ferry Point in the Bronx.\n\nEngoron also wrote that Trump would be required for interest on those payments, which could potentially add as much as $100 million to the total he\u2019s ultimately required to pay.\n\nIn addition, Trump was barred from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in New York for a period of three years.\n\nEngoron gets the last word, and then some\n\nTrump repeatedly attacked Engoron and the case throughout the 11-week trial on social media, outside the courtroom \u2013 and even to the judge\u2019s face while he testified.\n\nOn Friday, Engoron got the last word, painting Trump as a \u201cpathological\u201d fraudster who would not stop unless forced.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 refusal to admit error \u2013 indeed, to continue it, according to the Independent Monitor \u2013 constrains this Court to conclude that they will engage in it going forward unless judicially restrained,\u201d Engoron wrote.\n\nEngoron acknowledged that the sins Trump committed \u2013 which his lawyers frequently argued had no victim because banks were repaid and often eager to do business with Trump\u2019s company \u2013 were not as serious as some crimes. But he faulted Trump and his co-defendants for a complete lack of contrition.\n\n\u201cThis is a venial sin, not a mortal sin. Defendants did not commit murder or arson. They did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Donald Trump is not Bernard Madoff. Yet, defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways. Instead, they adopt a \u2018See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\u2019 posture that the evidence belies,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nEngoron even turned to poetry to make his point: \u201cThe English poet Alexander Pope (1688-1744) first declared, \u2018To err is human, to forgive is divine.\u2019 Defendants apparently are of a different mind.\u201d\n\nEngoron was critical of Trump\u2019s testimony on the stand, when the former president mostly ignored questions and took the opportunity instead to give political speeches attacking the case, the attorney general and the judge. At first, Engoron tried to rein Trump in \u2013 even threatening to remove him as a witness at one point \u2013 but he eventually gave up and let Trump rant in response to the questions from the attorney general\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cOverall, Donald Trump rarely responded to the questions asked, and he frequently interjected long, irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial,\u201d Engoron wrote. \u201cHis refusal to answer the questions directly, or in some cases, at all, severely compromised his credibility.\u201d\n\nNo corporate death penalty as judge backs off dissolving Trump Org.\n\nBelieve it or not, it could have been worse for Trump.\n\nThe judge banned him from serving as an officer or director of a New York corporation for three years, but did not issue the so-called corporate death penalty.\n\nIn September, Engoron issued a summary judgment dissolving Trump\u2019s business certificates in finding that Trump and his co-defendants were liable for persistent and repeated fraud.\n\nBut he pulled back from that decision \u2013 which had been put on hold pending appeal \u2013 on Friday, writing that he no longer felt it was necessary because he was putting in place two different independent monitors to oversee the company going forward.\n\nThe independent monitor installed last fall will stay in place for at least three years, Engoron ruled. In addition, he ordered an independent director of compliance should be installed at the Trump Org. at the company\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cAs going forward there will be two-tiered oversight, an Independent Monitor and an Independent Director of Compliance, of the major activities that could lead to fraud, cancellation of the business licenses is no longer necessary,\u201d Engoron wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer \u2018told the truth\u2019\n\nEngoron recapped Michael Cohen\u2019s theatrical trial testimony, acknowledging the credibility issues with Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer.\n\nBut ultimately, Engoron said, he believed Cohen.\n\n\u201cAlthough the animosity between the witness and the defendant is palpable, providing Cohen with an incentive to lie, the Court found his testimony credible, based on the relaxed manner in which he testified, the general plausibility of his statements, and, most importantly, the way his testimony was corroborated by other trial evidence,\u201d Engoron wrote.\n\nEngoron pushed back on Trump\u2019s narrative that Cohen was a star witness for the attorney general on whose credibility the case could teeter.\n\n\u201cMichael Cohen was an important witness on behalf of the plaintiff, although hardly the linchpin that defendants have attempted to portray him to be,\u201d Engoron said.\n\nWhile the testimony from Trump\u2019s former fixer was compromised by his previous perjury plea in another case and some \u201cseeming contradictions\u201d in what he said at this trial, the judge said he believed Cohen when he testified that \u201cTrump did not expressly direct him to reverse engineer financial statements, he ordered him to do so indirectly, in his \u2018mob voice.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cA less-forgiving factfinder might have concluded differently, might not have believed a single word of a convicted perjurer,\u201d Engoron also wrote. \u201cThis factfinder does not believe that pleading guilty to perjury means that you can never tell the truth. Michael Cohen told the truth.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s adult sons banned for 2 years\n\nTrump\u2019s eldest sons \u2013 who\u2019ve essentially run the Trump Organization since 2017 \u2013 are barred from serving as executives in New York for two years, according to Engoron\u2019s order.\n\nThe Trumps will have to navigate the two-year penalty as they sort out the future of the family-run real estate company that also hasn\u2019t filled the chief financial officer or controller positions vacated by former Trump Org. execs Allen Weisselberg and Jeff McConney.\n\nDuring closing arguments last month, Engoron questioned whether the attorney general presented any evidence that Trump\u2019s eldest sons knew that there was fraud going on at the company \u2014 but ultimately found them liable for issuing false financial statements, falsifying business records and conspiracy claims.\n\n\u201cThey also served as co-executives running the company from January 2017 to today, in which they had intimate knowledge of the Trump Organization\u2019s business, assets, and were provided with financial updates upon request,\u201d Engoron wrote Friday.\n\nThe judge knocked Eric Trump\u2019s credibility in his ruling, pointing out inconsistent testimony he gave at trial.\n\n\u201cEric Trump\u2019s credibility was severely damaged when he repeatedly denied knowing that his father ever even compiled an SFC that valued his assets and showed his net worth \u2018until this case came into fruition.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe \u201cbegrudgingly\u201d conceded at trial that he actually knew about his father\u2019s statements as early as 2013 \u201cupon being confronted with copious documentary evidence conclusively demonstrating otherwise,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nEngoron also said Eric Trump unconvincingly tried to distance himself from some appraisals of Trump Org. properties that offered a much lower valuation than reported on Donald Trump\u2019s financial statements.\n\nEric and Donald Trump Jr. were both ordered to pay more than $4 million in disgorgement, or \u201cill-gotten\u201d profits, they personally received from the 2022 sale of Trump\u2019s hotel at the Old Post Office building in Washington DC.\n\nIvanka Trump gets to keep her profits on the building sale because she was dismissed as a defendant in the case by an appeals court ahead of trial. But that didn\u2019t stop Engoron from weighing in on her trial testimony, calling it \u201csuspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIvanka Trump was a thoughtful, articulate, and poised witness, but the Court found her inconsistent recall, depending on whether she was questioned by OAG or the defense, suspect,\u201d Engoron wrote. \u201cIn any event, what Ms. Trump cannot recall is memorialized in contemporaneous emails and documents; in the absence of her memory, the documents speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump reacts after judge orders him and companies to pay $355 million 02:00 - Source: CNN\n\nNext steps: Trump will appeal the ruling\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys have already appealed Engoron\u2019s summary judgment last year that found the former president liable for fraud \u2013 and Trump\u2019s attorneys are already planning to appeal this decision, too.\n\nTrump attorney Christopher Kise responded to Engoron\u2019s ruling in a statement on Friday, saying the court \u201cignored the law, ignored the facts.\u201d\n\nKise added Trump will appeal and \u201cremains confident the Appellate Division will ultimately correct the innumerable and catastrophic errors made.\u201d\n\nDuring the 11-week trial, Trump\u2019s attorneys repeatedly criticized Engoron\u2019s handling of the case and raised objections \u201cfor the record\u201d and a potential appeal.\n\nEngoron often acknowledged the likelihood of an appeal during the trial, raising his concerns with a reversal with the attorney general\u2019s lawyers when he allowed the testimony of certain witnesses the AG objected to as part of Trump\u2019s defense.\n\nThe reality is that the ruling is likely to be tied up in the courts on appeal for a long time, and Engoron\u2019s ruling Friday was written with an eye toward surviving an appellate challenge.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.",

        "article_text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nThe jury in the civil corruption trial against the National Rifle Association and its top executives will continue deliberations when court resumes on Tuesday.\n\nCourt is now in recess for the weekend, including the Monday public holiday.\n\nThe jury began deliberations Friday morning in a case that spotlights one of the most powerful lobbying groups in a nation with more civilian guns than people.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its top executives engaged in mass corruption and should pay back to the organization millions of dollars spent on personal expenses, the New York attorney general\u2019s office said during closing arguments of the group\u2019s civil corruption trial.\n\nThe defendants \u2013 the NRA, former CEO Wayne LaPierre, former CFO Wilson \u201cWoody\u201d Philips and general counsel John Frazer \u2013 were caught \u201cwith their hands in the cookie jar,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Monica Connell said in closing arguments Thursday. They denied, deflected and blamed each other for failing to properly administer charitable money and violating non-profit laws in a breach of their fiduciary duties, she said.\n\n\u201cWhat happens when someone is caught in the act?\u201d Connell asked. \u201cWhat are they going to do? What does our common sense and life experience tell us they\u2019re going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cStopping illegal conduct after you\u2019ve been caught does not make your misconduct disappear,\u201d Connell added.\n\nLaPierre, who last month stepped dow\ufeffn from his NRA role, citing his health, testified he wasn\u2019t in it for the money, Instead, the expenses were part of an effort to bolster the organization\u2019s reach and importance, he said.\n\nConnell said LaPierre engaged in a long history of corruption by spending money on private planes, cars, five-star hotels, hundreds of thousands of dollars of clothing, million-dollar deals to insiders, and payments to loyal board members.\n\nThe NRA paid $600,000 alone on private flights to the Bahamas for LaPierre, and hair and makeup expenses totaled approximately $41,000, according to Connell.\n\nThe NRA\u2019s contract with its former advertising firm MMP increased every time LaPierre or his wife spent time on the yacht of the owners of Ackerman McQueen, an MMP entity, she said.\n\nFrom 2015 through 2022, the NRA paid MMP entities $109 million, and Connell told the jury this amount should be paid in damages split among LaPierre, Philips and Frazer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about trust of NRA donors\u201d and members who gave hard-earned money to charity, Connell said.\n\nAG asks jury to award money to NRA\n\nThe hiring and removal of Oliver North, a former NRA president who earlier testified for the state, is a clear example of LaPierre\u2019s corruption, Connell said.\n\nLaPierre placed him in the presidential role without approval and offered North a million-dollar contract, later suppressing and ousting him, once North raised concerns, she told jurors.\n\nConnell also argued LaPierre kept a group of loyalists in the NRA board who protected, \u201cWayne\u2019s world.\u201d\n\nIn an unusual twist, members of the NRA could benefit from a verdict against former leaders. Connell said no money would be paid to the state.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office is asking the jury to find against LaPierre and others, and that they reimburse and pay penalties to the organization.\n\n\u201cThis is not a witch hunt,\u201d Connell said. \u201cThe attorney general is trying to get money wrongfully taken from the NRA back to the NRA.\u201d\n\nDefense: \u2018It was in the interest of the NRA\u2019\n\nLaPierre\u2019s attorney Kent Correll argued during closing arguments Thursday morning the former CEO \u201cwasn\u2019t interested in building a big pile of money for himself; he wasn\u2019t interested in getting money through a back door at the organization.\u201d\n\nThe state had suggested every private flight LaPierre took \u201cwas somehow a personal flight,\u201d Correll said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t. It was in the interest of the NRA.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe AG doesn\u2019t want you to look at the heroism. They don\u2019t want you to look at the freedom he has fought for. They don\u2019t want you to look at the 4 million members,\u201d he said.\n\nCorrell said the New York attorney general set out to destroy the organization and she knew the best way to do that was to get to LaPierre.\n\n\u201cShe (Letitia James) wanted to decapitate the organization, and that was for political reasons,\u201d he said.\n\nNRA attorney Sarah Rodgers said the misconduct against the non-profit was concealed from the organization, and the mere fact that damages are payable to the group and not the state \u201ctells you what we need to know\u201d about the case.\n\n\u201cIf anything was found where I received an advantage, where I received benefits, I wanted to pay it back in interest, which is what I did,\u201d LaPierre testified.",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe deadly mass shooting that unfolded Wednesday following a Super Bowl celebration rally in Kansas City \u2013 a city that recorded its deadliest-ever year in 2023 \u2013 occurred in a state known to have some of the weakest gun laws in the country.\n\nThe gunfire killed a 43-year-old woman and injured at least 23 others during a Kansas City Chiefs parade where around 1 million people gathered to celebrate, and prompted calls from the Biden administration for Congress to pass \u201creasonable gun safety laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we waiting for? What else do we need to see? How many more families need to be torn apart?\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe lax gun laws in Missouri, where at least 155 mass shootings have happened since 2013, have created challenges for law enforcement and officials in preventing and investigating gun violence in the state. Here\u2019s why.\n\nMissouri\u2019s weak laws have led to gun deaths spike\n\nWhile Missouri does have partial open carry regulations and certain child access prevention laws in place, the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence has said the state\u2019s gun laws are \u201cappallingly weak.\u201d\n\nMissouri ranks 38th among the 50 states when it comes to gun law strength; California leads the country with the toughest enacted gun laws and Arkansas ranks at 50 for the weakest, according to Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nThe gun control advocacy and gun violence prevention-focused nonprofit says Missouri, which is among the top 10 states with the most firearm-related deaths, lacks any \u201cof the foundational gun violence prevention laws\u201d \u2013 including passing background checks and/or purchase permitting, secure gun storage requirements, requiring a concealed carry permit, Extreme Risk laws and rejecting Shoot First laws.\n\nExtreme Risk laws, also called Red Flag laws, temporarily prevent a person in crisis from accessing guns by letting police or loved ones intervene through petitioning a court order.\n\nShoot First laws, or Stand Your Ground laws, \u201callow people to shoot and kill in public even if they can safely walk away from the situation,\u201d according to Everytown.\n\nThe state\u2019s 2007 repeal of an 80-year-old permit-to-purchase law led to around a 27% rise in the state\u2019s gun homicide rate, according to Everytown.\n\n\u201cMissouri is a gun rights paradise, but this clearly has public safety implications,\u201d said Jennifer Mascia, a CNN contributor and senior news writer at The Trace, a nonprofit journalism outlet focusing on gun-related news.\n\nThe state\u2019s gun laws were rolled back specifically to prevent incidents like Wednesday\u2019s shooting \u2013 \u201cto allow \u2018good guys with guns\u2019 to easily access weapons and defend themselves and their communities,\u201d Mascia said.\n\nCrime scene tape hangs from a fence following the prior day's shooting at Kansas City's Union Station. Emmalee Reed/CNN\n\nBut today, Mascia noted, Missouri has one of the highest gun-death rates in the United States.\n\nThe state\u2019s lax gun laws have allowed for firearms to reach criminal hands through legal gun owners by way of theft, private sales and straw buyers, Mascia explained.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no mechanism in our laws to periodically check in with gun owners and make sure they\u2019re properly handling their guns, and locking them up and reporting thefts,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true in Missouri, where you can buy a gun in a private sale and carry it in public with no background check and no authorities ever being notified.\u201d\n\nHow Missouri\u2019s gun laws make crime investigation difficult\n\nWhile some leaders, including Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas and St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones, have pushed back against Missouri\u2019s restrictions on its cities\u2019 ability to fight gun violence, the state \u2013 which controls law enforcement in Kansas City \u2013 has made it \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for cities to do so, according to Everytown.\n\nThe state enacted the Second Amendment Preservation Act in 2021, which would subject local and state law enforcement officers to $50,000 fines for helping to enforce a federal gun law, according to the Giffords Law Center.\n\nHowever, in a 24-page decision last March, US District Judge Brian Wimes ruled the law is \u201cinvalidated as unconstitutional in its entirety,\u201d CNN previously reported.\n\nThe US Supreme Court rejected an emergency petition by the State of Missouri to block Wimes\u2019 decision.\n\nThe Missouri State Capitol is seen Friday, September 16, 2022, in Jefferson City. Jeff Roberson/AP\n\nMissouri cities, including Kansas City, can\u2019t pass their own gun laws; only the state legislature can, according to Mascia.\n\n\u201cBut cities have been trying: Several initiatives vying for the Missouri ballot in November would reinstate the ability of cities to make their own gun laws \u2014 specifically Kansas City and St. Louis,\u201d she said.\n\nMissouri lawmakers have also introduced several gun-related bills during the 2024 state legislative session, including legislation to lower the age requirement for carrying a concealed firearm from 19 to 18 and legislation to allow the state to take control of municipal law enforcement agencies from city government \u2013 a measure that \u201cwould frustrate the ability of Missouri cities to combat gun violence,\u201d according to Everytown.\n\nFollowing Wednesday\u2019s deadly shooting in Kansas City, police face the critical challenge of not only determining whether firearms recovered at the scene were fired during the mass shooting, but also linking each weapon to a specific shooter.\n\nPermissive gun laws make this even more challenging because weapons can easily change hands without registration requirements that would allow police to quickly trace the owner of a firearm.\n\nBullets, shell casings are major focus of investigation\n\nSpecialists from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives are also analyzing bullets recovered at the scene and from victims to determine which gun was responsible for killing or injuring specific people, a law enforcement source told CNN.\n\nEjected casings are additionally being studied to identify whether unique markings left behind on a shell casing by a gun during firing \u2013 similar to a fingerprint \u2013 match other shootings in law enforcement databases, the source said.\n\nIn addition to helping tie those guns to rounds fired at the scene, the source said ATF investigators are working to determine whether any bullets and shell casings recovered fail to fit the unique profile of those recovered weapons, which could indicate additional suspects are at large.\n\nBut even if a firearm associated with Wednesday\u2019s mass shooting does match with a weapon in the ATF\u2019s database of previous shootings, the absence of any laws in Missouri requiring registration, coupled with the ability of gun owners to anonymously transfer weapons through private sales, does not guarantee police will be any closer to identifying the person who pulled the trigger.\n\nCNN\u2019s Ariane de Vogue and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

        "article_text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nCaitlin Clark made history Thursday as women\u2019s college basketball\u2019s all-time leading scorer. The Iowa star is also an economic powerhouse, putting a spotlight on the multi-million dollar earning potential of some athletes in a new era of profitability in college sports.\n\nClark, 22, has signed deals with Gatorade, Nike and State Farm, among others. Sports data site On3 estimates the total value of those partnerships at $818,000 \u2014 the fifth-highest ranking in all of women\u2019s college sports, and multiples higher than Clark can expect to make as a pro in the WNBA, where the top salary currently maxes out around $250,000.\n\nHer star power is also filling seats, boosting TV ratings and moving merchandise.\n\nClark\u2019s stardom reflects women\u2019s growing marketing power in college sports, three years after a Supreme Court ruling allowed student athletes to make money off their personal brand and amid booming interest in women\u2019s sports broadly. Brands are increasingly hungry to partner with college athletes who can help them reach younger consumers, especially young women who are most likely to cultivate loyal social media followings. And the growing profiles of top athletes like Clark are helping to bring more attention \u2014 and more revenue \u2014 to women\u2019s college sports programs and professional leagues.\n\n\u201cCorporate America obviously wants to target younger people, and part of that is the lifetime customer value,\u201d said Patrick Rishe, director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis. He added that Clark herself has a following of \u201cClarkies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese preteen and teenage girls that are huge fans of Caitlin Clark\u2019s, they\u2019re watching the commercials and they see her drinking Gatorade and they see her on a State Farm commercial,\u201d Rishe said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if that brand recognition and reinforced messaging is going to lead to those young girls eventually becoming State Farm customers \u2026 but that\u2019s the hope.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, college athletes were not allowed to be paid. But a 2021 Supreme Court ruling allowed student athletes to make money off their personal brand \u2014 their name, image and likeness, known as NIL.\n\nThe total market for commercial NIL deals for college athletes is expected to reach an estimated $200 million in 2024, according to Opendorse, an online platform that helps connect athletes with NIL deals. And for top athletes like Clark, multi-year deals with major brands are likely \u201cstarting in the six figures,\u201d Sam Weber, head of marketing and communications at Opendorse, told CNN.\n\nRepresentatives for Clark did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe NIL change is especially empowering for female athletes, whose post-college professional path \u2014 if it exists at all \u2014 is far less lucrative than men\u2019s.\n\nThat\u2019s particularly visible in basketball. Currently, LSU stars Angel Reese and Flau\u2019jae Johnson boast NIL valuations above $1 million, according to On3\u2019s NIL ranking. Their prospects in the professional league \u2014 where the average salary in 2023 was around $113,000, according to Spotrac \u2014 are meager by comparison. (By contrast, even professional men\u2019s basketball players ranked below the top 100 athletes in the NBA can make upwards of $10 million each year.)\n\nTop brands in particular may be eager to ink endorsement deals with pro-bound college athletes that can last the entirety of their careers, Weber said. He cited similar, long-term relationships Nike has had with athletes like golfer Tiger Woods, who began his 27-year relationship with the brand at age 20, and basketball star LeBron James, who signed with the shoe company, in what eventually became a lifetime deal, as a high school senior.\n\n\u201cLarge brands and massive media agencies, what they see (in a player like Clark), that doesn\u2019t go away when she puts on a WNBA jersey,\u201d Weber said.\n\nThe growing public profiles of college athletes has also meant additional funds for their schools and athletics programs.\n\nSeason tickets for the Iowa Hawkeyes women\u2019s basketball team sold out this year for the first time in the program\u2019s history. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s pivotal game in Iowa City against the Michigan Wolverines, tickets prices were averaging $400 a seat, about 206% more expensive than the same game in November, according to TickPick.\n\nFor Iowa\u2019s March 3 home game against No. 2-ranked Ohio State, ticket prices were already topping $450 for the cheapest seat on StubHub on Friday, maxing out above $1,000.\n\nTickPick estimates the game will be the most expensive in women\u2019s college basketball history.\n\nThis past Sunday, Nebraska\u2019s victory over Iowa in Lincoln attracted 1.7 million viewers \u2014 the most-watched women\u2019s college basketball game ever on Fox Sports.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that name, image and likeness may be one of the largest reasons why we\u2019ve seen such an acceleration in the growth of women\u2019s sports and the business of women\u2019s sports,\u201d Rishe said. Women college athletes \u201cnow have the ability to build a brand for themselves, such that when they graduate, they can further monetize the image that they\u2019ve crafted. And it also helps these women\u2019s sports leagues because now you\u2019ve got college stars joining professional leagues that now have a bigger aura, a greater recognition, than they ever had before.\u201d",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s way of doing business is a window into his soul.\n\nSo his devastating loss Friday in a New York fraud case that threatens the empire on which he built his art of the deal mythology encapsulates more than a legal defeat.\n\nIt offers a character study of the behavior, beliefs and worldview that define the DNA of an irrepressible figure and unchained force who is again tearing at American unity, institutions, democracy and the rule of law as another contentious election looms.\n\nA trial, which Trump tainted with histrionics and contempt for the judicial system, and Judge Arthur Engoron\u2019s final, stinging judgment, revealed four foundational codes that explain Trump\u2019s tumultuous path through a life that he simply sees as an endless stream of business and political deals he must close.\n\nTrump thinks rules are for other people. He will always break them in seeking more wealth, more attention, or more votes.\n\nIf reality doesn\u2019t get the ex-president what he wants, he conjures a new one.\n\nTrump is compelled always to fight \u2014 even when stepping back would be smarter.\n\nAnd when accountability finally arrives, he sees justice as an act of persecution by his enemies.\n\nThese Trump traits leap out of a staggering 92-page ruling handed down by Engoron, which left Trump facing a half-billion-dollar hole in his finances because of penalties and obligations in this and other cases.\n\nThe judge encapsulated the former president\u2019s brazen refusal to play by the same rules under which everyone else must live \u2014 and that in this case are the key to a functioning banking and economic system \u2014 with the words: \u201c The frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience.\u201d\n\nBut evidence never swayed Trump before and will not now, despite his crushing defeat. Whenever he loses, he just doubles down with a bigger falsehood \u2014 in this case that a fair legal process was simply a political attack by President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cAll comes out of the DOJ, it all comes out of Biden,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a witch hunt against his political opponent, the likes of which our country has never seen.\u201d\n\nThe climax of the case deepened the extraordinary legal morass facing Trump who is embroiled in multiple cases and faces the first of his criminal trials next month. The judgment portrays Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization, flouting business ethics, rules and laws to pull valuations for their property assets out of the air to get favorable loans, and then even more remarkably, refusing to accept the facts of their conduct when confronted with the evidence.\n\nPractically, Engoron\u2019s decision will impose severe financial and personal strain on Trump as he\u2019s emerging as the almost certain Republican presidential nominee. While Trump boasts of being a billionaire many times over, it\u2019s unclear if he has the liquidity to pay what he owes or if some of the \u201cbeautiful buildings\u201d and golf resorts over which he often waxes fondly in campaign speeches are at risk. An emperor has no clothes moment that reveals the ex-president as less wealthy than he claims could threaten the mogul\u2019s mystique on which he built his political brand and his self-identity.\n\nWarning signs for Trump\n\nPerhaps most concerning for Trump, Friday\u2019s defeat suggests the shield of impunity that has allowed his rampaging political and business career is fraying. It comes only three weeks after a jury in a defamation case in Manhattan awarded the writer E. Jean Carroll $83 million in compensatory damages for public statements he made in 2019 disparaging her and denying her rape allegations.\n\nWhile the ex-president\u2019s strategy of basing his legal defenses on a political argument that he\u2019s a victim of persecution from the Biden administration may be working in the campaign \u2014 at least for now \u2014 it is no match for the exacting standards of a court of law. At a defining moment of Trump\u2019s fraud trial, when he was effectively making a campaign speech from the stand, Engoron asked Trump\u2019s lawyer: \u201cCan you control your client?\u201d Of course, no one has ever been able to do so. But Engoron\u2019s ruling shows that the legal system has the power to constrain Trump and impose consequences that the political system lacks, despite two impeachments and a lost presidential election. This must be a worry for Trump as he faces four criminal trials, and may partly explain his desire to win back power since presidential authority could help him block or reverse convictions \u2013 at least in federal cases.\n\nTrump is also absorbing a double blow from New York, the larger-than-life city and state where he built towering skyscrapers and an outrageous personality based on an all-publicity-is-good-publicity attitude to 1980s tabloids. On Thursday, another New York judge locked in March 25 as the start date for his first criminal trial \u2014 over hush money payments to a former adult film star. The next day, the real estate empire that literally changed Manhattan\u2019s skyline was rocked by Engoron\u2019s verdict.\n\nTrump has long since decamped to Florida, but Engoron\u2019s ban on him running a New York corporation for three years will still sting. New York brashness and high stakes made Trump who he is. But his outlandishness has also repeatedly made him a Manhattan outsider. And now the city is rejecting him again, as part of a longterm trend that surely shaped Trump\u2019s political super skill \u2014 his capacity to identify and harness the frustration of Americans who feel themselves rejected and condescended to by East Coast political, economic and media elites.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell how Trump\u2019s loss on Friday will affect his political campaign. The dizzying line-up of cases against him has only cemented his bond with Make American Great Again voters who bought into his expertly crafted narrative of persecution that rescued an initially lackluster 2024 election campaign and has him on the verge of capturing his third straight Republican nomination. The advantage of Trump\u2019s sense of victimization is that every reverse further fuels it. One of his closest allies, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, therefore was able to ignore the overwhelming evidence revealed in the case of his malfeasance to declare: \u201cThe American people will not stand for this; they will elect President Trump as our 47th President of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut for all of Biden\u2019s political vulnerabilities, it\u2019s hard to see how Trump\u2019s increasing list of legal losses will improve his standing with the suburban moderate, swing state voters who paved the way to his loss in 2020. His remaining GOP foe Nikki Haley is making this point in her rallies. \u201cMarch and April, he\u2019s in one case court case. May and June, he\u2019s in another,\u201d Haley said while campaigning on Thursday ahead of the South Carolina primary. \u201cHe\u2019s already said he\u2019s going to spend most of this year in a courtroom, not on a campaign trail. That\u2019s not a way you win.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s ruling may turn out to be another blow to Republicans in a week in which they lost a key special election in New York and the GOP House majority bolted Washington in disarray. Biden, after a rough trot dominated by questions about his age, had a better week, as Tom Suozzi\u2019s election win cooled panic among Democrats over their 2024 prospects and after the FBI charged an ex-informant with lying, in a move that eviscerated the GOP\u2019s impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nFlouted rules, new realities and a busted legal strategy\n\nTrump\u2019s belief that the rules are for others defines his business and political life. It\u2019s essential, for example, to his claim now before the Supreme Court that presidents enjoy absolute immunity and cannot be prosecuted for their actions after they leave office.\n\nEngoron, meanwhile, marveled at the ex-president\u2019s audacity in flouting business ethics in inflating the values of his real estate and then his refusal to accept the truth of his actions when confronted with the evidence. \u201cDefendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways. Instead, they adopt a \u2018See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\u2019 posture that the evidence belies,\u201d he wrote. Engoron explained that such a crushing verdict was necessary to account for Trumps ill-gotten gains \u2014 because he believes they will continue in the absence of a painful price: \u201cDonald Trump testified that, even today, he does not believe the Trump Organization needed to make any changes based on the facts that came out during this trial.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to create a convenient reality is also at the heart of the case filed against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James, which rested on accusations that he serially inflated the values of his holdings to obtain better terms from banks and financial firms and to ultimately make more money. The ex-president claims that there were no victims from his behavior and that everyone made money. Yet regular Americans wouldn\u2019t get away with such conduct in their far less lucrative financial lives and investments. And Engoron argued that he was obligated to \u201cprotect the integrity of the financial marketplace and, thus, the public as a whole.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s propensity to simply alter truth and fact transferred easily from the business world to politics. It emerged hours into his presidency when he declared he had the biggest inaugural crowd ever despite photos proving the contrary. And his greatest fraud rests in his lies that he won the 2020 election and that the Constitution gave him the right to stay in power despite his defeat. The con-game of plucking a number out of the air to vastly over value his Trump Tower triplex is not that much different, after all, than calling Georgia election officials and asking them to \u201cfind\u201d votes so that he could overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the key swing state.\n\nIn his book, \u201cNever Enough,\u201d author Michael D\u2019Antonio shows how Trump was taught by a demanding father and teachers that he needed to be \u201ca killer\u201d and that winning \u201cwas the only thing.\u201d This explains his relentless willingness to fight, his never-ending legal crusades and his fervent desire at 77 years old to win back power after a humiliating election loss that nearly wrecked American democracy. Yet this refusal to ever admit defeat also appears to be leading Trump into dangerous legal territory.\n\nThe former president\u2019s fight at all costs legal strategy seems to be coming unstuck. \u201cTrump is unique in that he stubbornly thumbs his nose at our justice system and finds himself in legal turmoil,\u201d said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to cooperate with authorities or to settle a civil lawsuit rather than fight a losing battle.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, the battle itself and the act of breaking rules are the point of existence itself, even when they lead him into legal and constitutional peril. His flawed philosophy that in business and life, it\u2019s all about closing one more deal, means that even crushing defeats like the 2020 election and his fraud trial cannot change him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do it for the money. I\u2019ve got enough, much more than I\u2019ll ever need,\u201d Trump wrote in \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d He added: \u201cI do it to do it. Deals are my art form.\u201d",

        "article_text": "Editor\u2019s Note: David Orentlicher is the Judge Jack and Lulu Lehman Professor at the William S. Boyd School of Law at University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he specializes in constitutional law and health law. He also serves as a Democrat in the Nevada Assembly. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nBetween March and August, prosecutors indicted former President Donald Trump four times for alleged crimes. In September, New York civil court Judge Arthur Engeron ruled that Trump had committed business fraud when seeking financing for his real estate deals, and on Friday Engeron imposed his penalties for the civil offenses: The judge ordered Trump to pay $355 million in damages; he also banned Trump from serving as an officer or a director of a business in New York for the next three years.\n\nDavid Orentlicher R. Marsh Starks/UNLV Creative Services\n\nWhile Friday\u2019s ruling seems like a significant setback for Trump, it more likely will end up as a defeat for the legal system. So far, the prosecutions of Trump have been followed by an increase in his support and a decline in public trust in the legal process, at least among Republicans.\n\nFrom July to December, Trump\u2019s support among Republican primary voters rose from 54% to 64%. Last month, Trump trounced his competition in the Iowa caucuses, more than doubling his 2016 Iowa vote, and he also cruised to a first-place finish in the New Hampshire primary. Even among all Americans, Trump seems to be doing better. In Wall Street Journal polls, President Joe Biden\u2019s 2 point lead in December 2022 flipped to a 4 point Trump lead this past December.\n\nIt is essential to hold Trump accountable for his misconduct, and he may ultimately serve time in prison once courts decide his four criminal cases. But so far, public officials have done more damage to the law than to Trump, pushing too far in their efforts to punish the former president. Instead of leading many voters to distrust Trump, the legal cases are leading voters to distrust the legal system.\n\nAfter Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump in August for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, an ABC News poll found that 46% of surveyed Americans believed the charges to be politically motivated, with only 40% not thinking so. In June, more than 60% of Americans polled said that they thought political motivations explained Smith\u2019s indictment of Trump on charges of mishandling classified documents. A majority of Americans similarly told pollsters that they did not see a legal basis behind charges related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol or hiding hush money payments to cover up an extramarital affair.\n\nIt\u2019s important for the public to feel that the Trump prosecutions are legitimate. It\u2019s especially important for those who will be rendering verdicts on Trump. But some of the prospective jurors in his damages trial for defaming E. Jean Carroll said they believed that Trump is being treated unfairly by the legal system.\n\nOther polls also reveal worrisome trends. In Gallup\u2019s 2022 and 2023 surveys about major societal institutions, public confidence in the US Supreme Court \u2013 which will have the final say on whether Trump should serve time, be disqualified from running again for the presidency or go unpunished \u2013 plummeted to new, troubling lows.\n\nIt is essential that, whichever way the courts decide the Trump cases, the public thinks he got a fair shake by the legal system. But in their zeal to pursue the former president, prosecutors and judges are diminishing public trust by pushing the limits of the law.\n\nIn the business fraud case, for example, Engoron has stretched the law in problematic ways. When he concluded that the former president had fraudulently inflated his net worth in financial statements to banks and other lenders, the judge initially ordered that Trump\u2019s New York companies be dissolved. Moreover, his order applied to all of the companies, not just the ones implicated in the wrongful statements. But according to experts in New York law, the applicable statutes only allow Engoron to punish the companies charged with fraud, and even for those, it doesn\u2019t give Engoron the authority to shut the businesses down (which may explain why an appeals court placed the dissolution order on hold, and why Engoron did not incorporate dissolution into Friday\u2019s judgment).\n\nOther cases also are troubling. In the hush money prosecution, Trump would be the first candidate ever convicted for such payments if Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg prevails. In Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis is using a racketeering law designed to dismantle organized crime groups like the Mafia to police electoral misconduct. And in disqualifying Trump from the primary ballot, the Colorado Supreme Court and Maine secretary of state relied on discredited punishments of slavery opponents, advocates for workers\u2019 rights and war protesters. For many Americans, all of these distortions validate their sense that the Trump prosecutions are partisan.\n\nAs they erode public trust, public officials solidify Trump\u2019s support. It is not surprising that Trump seems to be benefiting from his legal troubles. Trump regularly mobilizes his constituency by claiming that his prosecutions are politically motivated and designed to shut him and his supporters down. Stretching the law in dubious ways only reinforces those claims.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion\u2019s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nTo be sure, law enforcement officials should not stay their hands just because Trump might exploit efforts to hold him accountable. But officials need to act much more scrupulously in their efforts. When prosecutors or judges overreach, they play into Trump\u2019s strategy of victimhood, increasing his chances for reelection and compromising the public\u2019s faith in our legal system.",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nRussia is trying to develop a nuclear space weapon that would destroy satellites by creating a massive energy wave when detonated, potentially crippling a vast swath of the commercial and government satellites that the world below depends on to talk on cell phones, pay bills, and surf the internet, according to three sources familiar with US intelligence about the weapon.\n\nThese sources gave CNN a more detailed understanding of what Russia is working on \u2013 and the threat it could pose \u2013 than the US government has previously disclosed.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, set off a frenzy in Washington on Wednesday when he issued a statement saying his panel \u201chad information concerning a serious national security threat.\u201d By Friday, President Joe Biden had publicly confirmed that Turner was referring to a new Russian nuclear anti-satellite capability \u2014 but officials have steadfastly refused to discuss it further, citing the highly classified nature of the intelligence.\n\nThe weapon is still under development and is not yet in orbit, Biden administration officials have emphasized publicly. But if used, officials say, it would cross a dangerous rubicon in the history of nuclear weapons and could cause extreme disruptions to everyday life in ways that are difficult to predict.\n\nThis kind of new weapon \u2014 known generally by military space experts as a nuclear EMP \u2014 would create a pulse of electromagnetic energy and a flood of highly charged particles that would tear through space to disrupt other satellites winging around Earth.\n\nBiden on Friday emphasized publicly that there is \u201cno nuclear threat to the people of America or anywhere else in the world with what Russia is doing at the moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything that they\u2019re doing and/or they will do relates to satellites and space and damaging those satellites, potentially,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Defense Department and the intelligence community have tracked Russian efforts to develop a broad range of anti-satellite weapons, including an EMP, for years.\n\nAnd there has been a stream of intelligence reporting in recent months related specifically to Russia\u2019s efforts to develop nuclear-powered anti-satellite capabilities, according to one defense official.\n\nBut Russia has recently made progress in its efforts to develop a nuclear EMP \u2014 a related but far more alarming technology.\n\n\u201cOur general knowledge of Russian pursuit of this kind of capability goes back many, many months, if not a few years,\u201d National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Thursday. \u201cBut only in recent weeks now has the intelligence community been able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia continues to pursue it.\u201d\n\nThe intelligence community, Biden said, had \u201cfound out there was a capacity to launch a system into space that could theoretically do something that was damaging\u201d but that it \u201chadn\u2019t happened yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new concept and, as a concept, dates back to the late Cold War,\u201d said one US official. But, they said, \u201cthe big fear with any eventual EMP device in orbit [is] it might render large portions of particular orbits unusable\u201d by creating a minefield of disabled satellites that \u201cwould then prove dangerous to any new satellites we might try to put up to replace or repair the existing satellites.\u201d\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Defense Department and the National Security Council all declined to comment.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether the device as designed could impact GPS and nuclear command and control satellites, which operate in a higher orbit than the vast constellation of commercial and government satellites whizzing through low-Earth orbit. Those larger satellites are designed to be impregnable to a nuclear blast, but a former top space official at the Pentagon told CNN that \u201cthey could be vulnerable\u201d depending on how close they were to the EMP, how old they are and how big the blast.\n\n\u2018Last-ditch weapon\u2019\n\nExperts say this kind of weapon could have the potential to wipe out mega constellations of small satellites, like SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, which has been successfully used by Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia.\n\nThis would almost certainly be \u201ca last-ditch weapon\u201d for Russia, the US official and other sources said \u2014 because it would do the same damage to whatever Russian satellites were also in the area.\n\nIt also remains unclear how well-developed the technology is. Russia has had a number of public debacles with their nuclear technology in recent years. In 2019, seven Russians were killed in a nuclear accident that occurred while Moscow was trying to recover a nuclear-powered cruise missile that had crashed into the White Sea during a failed test.\n\nStill, a recent intelligence assessment on Russian progress so alarmed some lawmakers on Capitol Hill that Turner issued an invitation to all members of the House to be read in on the matter.\n\nShortly thereafter, he issued the vague public statement that forced the issue into the public eye.\n\nSeveral sources familiar with the matter said that the exposure of the intelligence was extremely damaging because the source was incredibly sensitive. According to those sources, the intelligence community is now scrambling to figure out how to preserve its access.\n\nBiden administration officials contend that if Russia were to field a nuclear EMP, it would be the first-ever violation of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which bans stationing weapons of mass destruction in outer space.\n\n\u201cIt would be a violation of the Outer Space Treaty to which more than 130 countries have signed up to, including Russia,\u201d Kirby said Thursday, without providing details.\n\nRussia has withdrawn from several arms control treaties in recent years, leaving the post-Cold War arms control architecture all but gutted.",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nKansas City continued mourning after a mass shooting at the Chiefs Super Bowl victory rally left a mother of two dead and injured more than 20 others \u2013 including children \u2013 as investigators worked to figure out exactly how the violence unfolded.\n\nAuthorities on Friday said two teenagers would face charges connected to the deadly shooting on the west side of Union Station that sent frightened Chiefs fans running for cover following the parade that an estimated 1 million people attended on Wednesday.\n\nThe suspected juveniles, Kansas City police chief Stacey Graves said on Friday, \u201churt innocent people\u201d while \u201csimultaneously scarring an entire community\u201d after a joyous afternoon was transformed into one of panic and fear as gunfire was mistaken for fireworks.\n\nThis week, the Kansas City Chiefs \u2013 some of whom were still on the stage after the rally ended and the sounds of bullets pierced the air \u2013 embraced the still-reeling community, giving back through emergency funds for victims and families and visiting injured children in the hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, investigators, who recovered multiple guns from the scene, continue to piece together what unfolded Wednesday and say analyzing recovered bullets will help determine which gun was responsible for the death and injuries, a law enforcement source told CNN on Friday.\n\nThe shooting on Wednesday marked at least the 48th mass shooting to happen in the United States so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which like CNN counts those in which four or more are shot, not including a perpetrator.\n\nIt also marked the second time within a year that gunfire rang out at a major US sports title celebration after two people were wounded in June as Denver fans left a parade for the NBA\u2019s Nuggets.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the shooting and investigation.\n\nGunfire interrupts an afternoon of celebrating\n\nPeople flee after shots were fired near the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl LVIII victory parade on February 14, 2024, in Kansas City, Missouri.

As celebrations wrapped up, confetti was still floating toward the ground when attendees reported hearing an altercation and seeing a gun get drawn, CNN previously reported.\n\n\u201cPeople had started backing up, and then he pulled it out,\u201d Jacob Gooch Sr., who attended the rally with his wife, daughter and son, told CBS, \u201cand just started shooting and spinning in a circle.\u201d\n\nScreams were heard, and people scattered in fear.\n\nManny Abarca, a Jackson County legislator, told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates a warning quickly spread as a flood of people ran for safety: \u201cGuns, police, run.\u201d\n\nAuthorities say the shooting appears to have been a \u201cdispute between several people that ended in gunfire\u201d and there is no indication of a \u201cnexus to terrorism or homegrown violent extremism,\u201d according to Graves.\n\n43-year-old woman killed, several kids hurt\n\nThe gunfire killed Elizabeth \u201cLisa\u201d Lopez-Galvan, a 43-year-old mother and DJ who was remembered as an avid Kansas City Chiefs fan with a natural gift for bringing laughter to those she knew.\n\nAn undated photo of Lisa Lopez-Galvan.

        "article_text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to CNN Travel\u2019s Unlocking Italy newsletter for insider intel on Italy\u2019s best loved destinations and lesser-known regions to plan your ultimate trip. Plus, we\u2019ll get you in the mood before you go with movie suggestions, reading lists and recipes from Stanley Tucci.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nBuyers from all over the world are snapping up charming old houses in isolated villages in Italy. They\u2019re all motivated by different goals, but they have one thing in common: They all seek a retreat, somewhere they can escape to and live the rural idyll.\n\nChicago-based saxophonist Joshua Shapiro, 48, embarked on the quest for la dolce vita as the first step toward a change of life. His long-term goal is to move away from the United States, which he believes is taking a broad political shift that troubles him.\n\nIn 2022, he bought a small, abandoned apartment in the village of Latronico, deep in the southern region of Basilicata, for 22,000 euros (roughly $23,600), after reading CNN Travel\u2019s article about the clever housing program launched to attract migrants and stop depopulation.\n\nFor now, he drops in and out as he finalizes his home\u2019s makeover. In the future, he can see himself making the big leap to relocate permanently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ready for the next chapter in my life. Being a freelance saxophonist, mainly playing jazz and commercial, is not without challenges, and as taste and demand for what I do is notably decreasing [in the US], it might be in much higher demand in Europe,\u201d Shapiro tells CNN Travel.\n\nFor him, buying a dilapidated property in an unusual Italian spot is political, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the political situation in the US \u2013 the shift to the right. A huge swath of the electorate believes in another version of democracy, and how all this could pan out is a huge problem,\u201d he says.\n\nShapiro played his saxophone on his first trip to Latronico. MC Newman\n\nShapiro visited Latronico on a trip to Italy after the pandemic \u2013 the third time he\u2019d traveled to the country, and the first time in 20 years. He took along his saxophone, which he played from a house that he rented while his newly purchased home was being worked on. Villagers have fond memories of hearing jazz melodies in the winding alleys at night.\n\nWhat drew him to Italy was a \u201ctenuous link\u201d he wanted to revive \u2013 his grandfather had been stationed in Florence during World War II.\n\nLatronico is hardly Florence, though \u2013 it\u2019s a five-hour drive from Rome, and three from the nearest international airport, Bari. Shapiro admits the remote location \u201cweighed heavily\u201d on him as he journeyed to this pristine corner of Basilicata. He never expected it to be in such an out-of-the-way place, without any direct train connection.\n\n\u201cMy goal was to look around, see what was affordable, and what was being offered in terms of properties. With the assistance of deputy mayor Vincenzo Castellano, who handles the housing program, I picked the easiest option for me,\u201d he says.\n\nTwists and turns\n\nHis apartment is on the second floor with an independent entrance. Courtesy Joshua Shapiro\n\nHis second-floor apartment, which has its own external staircase and independent entrance, is 800 square feet, with two bedrooms and a panoramic balcony. It needed a thorough makeover, on which Shapiro has so far spent around 10,000 euros (roughly $10,730).\n\nDespite the excitement of buying a cheap home, the adventure he embarked on had a series of unexpected twists.\n\nHe had to put in new windows, re-tile it, and patch cracks in the walls. It also had to be furnished \u2013 Shapiro says that there was initially \u201chassle\u201d figuring out which furnishings were going to be included with the house sale.\n\nShapiro recalls initial \u201ccultural clashes over the odd furniture\u201d he found inside.\n\nHe expected the house to come with the furniture that was in the listing photos, to have one less thing to worry about at the start. But he says \u201cthere was either a miscommunication or misunderstanding about this issue\u201d with the owners.\n\nIn the United States, he says, the purchase contract would have stipulated what furniture was included with the apartment, but in Latronico, it was never quite clear.\n\nIt was never clear what furniture would be left for him. Courtesy Joshua Shapiro\n\nAs it was, some furniture was left for him, but it was \u201cworn out or not really usable,\u201d so he ultimately had to get rid of most of it.\n\n\u201cI was not expecting some things I found, like the bed was so old and decrepit. This became a contentious issue at the time, but we have very amicably resolved this situation while learning valuable lessons along the way,\u201d he says.\n\nMany empty homes featured on the local website where owners meet buyers are sold or rented with furniture, but what eventually ends up being left inside is usually negotiated between parties.\n\nHaving viewed it briefly before buying, Shapiro expected the home to be in better shape.\n\n\u201cIt needed a new roof, that was a big surprise. The kitchen was totally exposed to the sky, I had to add a downspout, and there was some junk inside the house which had to be thrown away.\u201d\n\nLatronico is in a remote, unspoiled part of Italy. Gianniblues/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nShapiro also repainted and patched up some walls \u2013 and there was more work to do to make it fully habitable.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of surprises and things I did not expect, like having to redo the bathroom, add a new hot water heater, and fix a moisture problem inside one bedroom.\n\n\u201cI was somewhat surprised at the work that needed to be done mostly due to the assumptions that I made about the condition simply due to the fact that it was being lived in prior to my purchase. I discovered later that the former occupants tolerated quite a bit of the deficiencies of the place.\u201d\n\nA difficult habit\n\nShapiro was taken round by the deputy mayor. Courtesy Joshua Shapiro\n\nThere was also a bizarre encounter when he first went to take a peek inside the house he had just bought.\n\nAccompanied by Castellano, the deputy mayor, Shapiro says he was surprised to find it had tenants inside \u2013 a group of elderly nuns.\n\n\u201cThere were these three nuns who had been living there for some time; they were tenants of the former owners. When I came, they wouldn\u2019t let me in, shocked by the idea that an American guy could walk around their house.\u201d\n\nLuckily everything was solved. The nuns, reassured by Castellano that they wouldn\u2019t end up homeless, eventually left. They were given alternative housing by the town council.\n\nDespite these initial hurdles, Shapiro says he immediately fell in love with Latronico\u2019s laid-back, slower-paced lifestyle \u2013 the opposite of what he was used to in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe village is tiny, set in a remote mountainous area. I live in a big city of millions of people. Latronico is a place I can envision being very creative in, playing, writing music,\u201d he says.\n\nHe says everyone has \u201cbent over backwards to be nice\u201d and been welcoming, bar \u201ca few sideline stares at the stranger in our midst\u201d \u2013 although he thinks that was mainly because of the language barrier. Not knowing Italian has not been easy for him, he says.\n\nShapiro, like all other foreign buyers in Latronico, is exempted from paying property and waste disposal taxes for five years, a measure recently introduced by the town hall to lure new buyers from abroad.\n\nAnd despite the unexpected building costs he\u2019s incurred, he is ecstatic to have had the opportunity to grab a home for what he considers a bargain price. In Chicago, he says, a condo costs $200,000 \u2013 plus property taxes.",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nA pair of skyscrapers connected by a cantilevered \u201cskybridge\u201d and a rooftop infinity pool is set to join the New York City skyline, as developers unveiled a proposal for a new megaproject just south of the United Nations headquarters on Monday.\n\nDesigned by architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG), the 615-foot-tall towers will contain two hotels, while a soaring lobby across the top will house restaurants, bars, an art gallery a glass-floored (and glass-ceilinged) viewing platform and \u2014 should a license be granted \u2014 a subterranean casino.\n\nAlong with two new residential towers, the skyscrapers will flank the newly unveiled Freedom Plaza development, a three-block-long public park with retail spaces and a new \u201cMuseum of Freedom and Democracy.\u201d\n\nThe Midtown Manhattan site, which overlooks the East River, is currently occupied by a large-scale art installation \u201cField of Light,\u201d by British Artist Bruce Munro, that was commissioned by the charitable arm of Soloviev Group, the property developer behind the plan. But the 6.7-acre patch of prime real estate, roughly the size of Madison Square Park, has sat largely unused since the 2000s.\n\nThe \"skybridge\" connecting the two hotel towers is set to feature a 150,000-gallon rooftop infinity pool. Bjarke Ingels Group\n\nBjarke Ingels, the Danish founder and creative director of BIG, said his firm\u2019s design looks to extend the greenery that architects Le Corbusier, Wallace Harrison and Oscar Niemeyer created at the neighboring UN building.\n\n\u201cWe continue to build on these architectural principles by uniting three city blocks to form a public green space reaching from 1st Avenue to the East River overlook, creating a green connection all the way to the water\u2019s edge,\u201d said Ingels in a press statement.\n\nThe two hotel towers are set to host the city\u2019s first five-star Banyan Tree property, as well as a hotel run by casino operator Mohegan. A 150,000-gallon infinity pool will be built on the roof of the connecting skybridge, with BIG describing it as \u201cone of the largest rooftop pools in North America.\u201d\n\nThe 50- and 60-story residential towers, meanwhile, nod to the modernist New York City buildings of the 1950s and 1960s thanks to their striped glass and aluminum facades. Measuring 550 and 650 feet tall, the two high-rises will be connected by a podium housing a food market and retail space.\n\nThe project's two residential towers will be connected at ground level by a podium housing a food market and retail space. Bjarke Ingels Group\n\nThe development is one of several projects competing for three casino gaming licenses recently approved for downstate New York by the state\u2019s gaming commission. But plans have faced local opposition, with some residents and officials voicing concern about the development. Hoping to entice authorities to grant the license, the Soloviev Group has said it would designate 513, or nearly 40% of the development\u2019s 1,325 apartments as affordable housing should the license come through.\n\n\u201cThe revenue generated by the project\u2019s entertainment and hospitality component will allow Freedom Plaza to deliver the affordable housing program and expansive publicly accessible green space, with many more details yet to be announced,\u201d said Ray Pineault, CEO and President of Mohegan in a statement last year.\n\nAmericans are currently living through the toughest housing market in a generation, and New York has been one of the hardest hit locations, with rental vacancy rates down to a multi-decade low of 1.4%, according to the 2023 NYC Housing and Vacancy Survey.\n\nThe development is set to occupy a 6.7-acre plot next to the East River in Midtown Manhattan. Bjarke Ingels Group\n\nSoloviev Group has also promised that an unspecified percentage of the gaming profits, starting with a minimum $5 million donation, will go to an independently run non-profit community fund.\n\nElsewhere on the site, BIG has designed a new \u201cMuseum of Freedom and Democracy\u201d that \u201ccelebrates the origin and evolution of one of the most impactful inventions of mankind and our continuous struggle to build, maintain and protect the institutions that uphold it,\u201d said Ingels.\n\nThe M\u00f6bius strip-shaped building, overlooking the river, winds on top of itself creating outdoor walking paths. BIG described the design as an homage to the amphitheaters built by the Ancient Greeks, the creators of modern democracy.\n\nFreedom Plaza will also contain public green space and a new Museum of Freedom and Democracy. Bjarke Ingels Group\n\nUnaffiliated with Long Island University\u2019s Museum of Democracy, the new institution will contain pieces of the Berlin Wall and works from the Soloviev Group\u2019s art collection.\n\n\u201cOur plan is to develop this site in a way that delivers benefits for the local neighborhood and the city as a whole, worthy of its skyline and waterfront location, and befitting New York City\u2019s key role as a leader in the global cultural economy,\u201d said Michael Hershman, CEO of the Soloviev Group, in a press release.\n\nGroundbreaking and completion dates are yet to be announced as the developers await a decision on the project\u2019s casino license but will likely be finished in five to seven years once building works commences.\n\nShould the license not be granted, the project will continue, likely based on a previous design approved in 2008, said the developer.",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nPaul McCartney\u2019s legendary lost guitar will gently weep no more as it was reunited with its owner more than 50 years after it was stolen.\n\nMcCartney played the distinctive H\u00f6fner bass guitar when recording The Beatles\u2019 first two albums, including legendary hits such as \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d and \u201cLove Me Do,\u201d before using it as a backup bass for the rest of his time with the band.\n\nHe continued to play it once The Beatles had split up but it was stolen in 1972 from the back of a van in Notting Hill, London.\n\nIt subsequently disappeared until the Lost Bass Project, run by H\u00f6fner executive Nick Wass and investigative journalists Scott and Naomi Jones, sifted through more than 100 leads to track down the lost guitar in Hastings, a town on the English south coast.\n\n\u201cThe search for the bass wasn\u2019t just for Paul McCartney, it was for all the fans,\u201d Wass told CNN on Friday. \u201cIt was so we could all see this \u2026 bass that kicked off Beatlemania.\u201d\n\nTheir search was widely publicized, and they detailed the guitar\u2019s distinguishing features, prompting the family who had the guitar to \u201ccome forward with photographs of the bass in their loft saying: \u2018Is this it?\u2019\u201d Scott Jones told CNN on Thursday.\n\nMcCartney is \u201cincredibly grateful to all those involved\u201d in returning the bass to him and verified that it is the same guitar he played so often in the 1960s, according to a statement on his website.\n\nWass first launched the Lost Bass Project in 2018 after a conversation with McCartney himself, he told CNN on Friday, but it wasn\u2019t until Scott and Naomi Jones joined the search after watching McCartney perform at Glastonbury that the \u201cuseful leads starting coming in.\u201d\n\nThe Beatles (from left to right), Paul McCartney (playing the stolen bass), George Harrison, Ringo Starr and John Lennon perform during a concert on July 29, 1965. Central Press/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter issuing an appeal in the media, the crucial breakthrough came in October 2023, when the team received a tip from two of McCartney\u2019s sound engineers who had parked the van in the Ladbroke Grove area of Notting Hill, as the former Beatle was recording an album nearby with his new band Wings.\n\nIt allowed them to discover precisely when and where the guitar had been stolen, dispelling earlier rumors that it had disappeared in 1969 just before the Beatles\u2019 final rooftop concert.\n\nThe location also matched up with an email that Wass had received earlier that year, which he had initially \u201cdisregarded\u201d because it \u201cdidn\u2019t really make sense,\u201d he said.\n\nWass added that he then asked for more information and the email sender said that his father had stolen the bass and taken it to Ronald Guest, landlord of the Admiral Blake pub nearby.\n\nMeanwhile, Naomi Jones trawled through archives to verify those addresses and confirm that the story held up.\n\n\u201cThe evidence along the way would suggest that the thief didn\u2019t know what he was stealing that night,\u201d Scott Jones said. \u201cI think to him it was just a guitar and he later found out that it was Paul McCartney\u2019s guitar.\u201d\n\nThe thief asked Guest to \u201ceffectively hide the guitar for him,\u201d Jones continued, and the team turned their attention to the pub, \u201cstarting to look through births, marriages and death records\u201d and tracing \u201cwhere the bass was going within the Guest family.\u201d\n\nAlthough the guitar is slightly damaged and will need some repairs before being played again, professionals will be able to restore it, the Lost Bass Project said.\n\n\u201cThis guitar is invaluable,\u201d Wass said. \u201cIn a sense it has no value except to Paul McCartney and to every Beatles fan in the world \u2026 it\u2019s priceless.\u201d",

Meihls, chief investigator for the Allen County Coroner\u2019s Office.\n\nA construction worker who was doing some renovations in a house on Reynolds Street, in the basement discovered a dead individual wrapped in a blanket and in 8 to 12 inches of water and very badly decomposed at that time, Allen County Coroner John Brandenberger said at a news conference Thursday.\n\nBased on the extent of decomposition of the 23-year-old\u2019s body, Brandenberger said investigators initially believed that Murlin had died in 1991 or early 1992.\n\nThe Allen County coroner conducted a partial autopsy on Murlin\u2019s body at the time and was unable to determine the cause of death.\n\nMurlin, who at the time was identified as \u2018Mary Jane Doe,\u2019 was subsequently buried at Lindenwood Cemetery on May 21, 1992, Brandenberger said.\n\nThe Fort Wayne Police Department developed leads and investigated the case, but it eventually grew cold. Over two decades later with technological advancements in forensic analysis, the investigation was reopened in 2016, the coroner explained.\n\nA year later, investigators decided to exhume Murlin\u2019s body to conduct a complete autopsy by doing x-rays of her teeth for forensic odontology and \u201cto complete an anthropology study\u201d to submit DNA of the remains to appropriate facilities, Brandenberger said.\n\nUniversity of Indianapolis Forensic Anthropologist Krista Latham collected DNA samples from Murlin\u2019s left femur and sent it to the University of North Texas\u2019 Center for Human Identification for DNA testing.\n\n\u201cSeven months later, the University of Texas announced that they had developed a DNA profile, which was uploaded into DNA databases,\u201d which Brandenberger said unfortunately did not result in any DNA matches.\n\nThe coroner shelved degraded samples of Murlin\u2019s extracted DNA until newer technology became available.\n\nIn 2023, forensic genealogy companies Intermountain Forensics and Ignite DNA began sequencing the DNA and from there was able to find a match between Murlin and her father, her mother, who died in 2013, as well as her two aunts, Bradenberger said.\n\nDNA obtained by a swab of the cheek confirmed Robert Bowers to be Murlin\u2019s father, according to case documents.\n\nAngelina Privitt, Murlin\u2019s aunt, identified Murlin with her maiden name Tabetha Slain and said she had been adopted by her other aunt, Norma Slain, according to the coroner\u2019s office.\n\nPrivitt claimed that the victim married her husband, Jerry Murlin, in 1987, according to case documents.\n\nThe couple separated 1988 but Murlin never filed for divorce and never reported his wife as missing, according to authorities.\n\nWhile details on the woman\u2019s death are still unclear to authorities, Bowers confirmed that he last saw his daughter in 1988, and Jerry Murlin last saw his wife in 1989, according to Meihls.\n\nCNN has reached out to Murlin and Bowers for comment.\n\nCNN has also reached out to the Fort Wayne Police Department for further comment.",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nThe Georgia election subversion case against Donald Trump and 14 of his allies took a stunning turn Thursday when two top prosecutors testified under oath about their romantic relationship at a hearing triggered by allegations of self-dealing that have the potential to derail the indictment.\n\nThe all-day hearing escalated steadily throughout the day, culminating with Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis taking the witness stand for a combative brawl with defense attorneys that drew several rebukes from the judge.\n\nJudge Scott McAfee convened the hearing after some of Trump\u2019s co-defendants surfaced allegations of a relationship between Willis and Nathan Wade, whom she hired in 2021 to join the prosecution team. Trump and his co-defendants want the judge to disqualify Willis\u2019 team from the case \u2013 or throw out the charges \u2013 because of a possible conflict-of-interest.\n\nThere was talk of cash exchanging hands from Willis to Wade, where they store their money at home, CashApp usage, and their spending habits \u2013 all to get to the question of whether Willis benefitted financially from putting him on her staff.\n\nWillis was expected to return Friday to be be cross-examined by district attorney lawyer Anna Cross, but Cross said at the beginning of Friday\u2019s hearing that she did not have any additional questions.\n\nThe judge said he does not plan to issue a ruling on Friday.\n\nHere are takeaways from the hearing that was at times jaw-dropping, awkward and strikingly personal.\n\nWillis\u2019 defiant afternoon on the stand\n\nWhat unfolded on Thursday is extremely rare in American courtrooms. The district attorney who has charged Trump with racketeering went under oath to defend her ethics and answer personal questions about her relationship with Wade.\n\nThe risks could not be greater, and Willis\u2019 credibility is on the line.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Erin Burnett on Fani Willis testimony: She tore into Trump's team 01:33 - Source: CNN\n\nThings quickly went off the rails. Willis didn\u2019t act much like a traditional witness and was more like a prosecutor, arguing with the defense attorneys, raising objections, making legal arguments and even having exchanges with the judge. She even raised her voice at one point.\n\nThis led to a few rebukes from McAfee, who urged her and other attorneys in the courtroom to maintain \u201cprofessionalism\u201d and to not \u201ctalk over each other.\u201d\n\nWillis repeatedly accused some of the defense attorneys of peddling lies \u2013 before and after the judge\u2019s admonishment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lied in this. \u2026 I think you lied right here,\u201d Willis said to attorney Ashleigh Merchant, pointing to copies of filings that raised accusations of self-dealing and nepotism.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not on trial,\u2019 Willis says\n\nWillis seized several opportunities to defend herself.\n\nThe district attorney had fought efforts to make her appear, both in Wade\u2019s ongoing divorce proceedings and in the hearing on Thursday, up until the moment she came into the room to take the stand. She said at the beginning of her testimony that she was \u201cvery anxious\u201d to defend herself, \u201cso I ran to the courtroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m on trial,\u201d Willis said, in her sharpest pushback of the day. \u201cThese people are on trial for trying to steal an election in 2020,\u201d she added, pointing toward the table of attorneys representing defendants in the criminal case. \u201cI\u2019m not on trial, no matter how hard you try to put me on trial.\u201d\n\nShe later slammed the defense attorneys, calling them \u201cconfused\u201d and \u201cintrusive.\u201d\n\n\u201cMs. Merchant\u2019s interests are contrary to democracy, not to mine,\u201d Willis said, attacking the attorney for Trump campaign attorney Michael Roman, who is accused of playing a leading role in the multi-state \u201cfake electors\u201d plot to subvert the Electoral College.\n\nWhen did the relationship start?\n\nOn the stand, Wade stuck to his earlier claim \u2013 in a sworn affidavit submitted to the court \u2013 that his romantic relationship with Willis began in early 2022 and that they split travel and vacation expenses.\n\nBut Robin Bryant-Yeartie, a former friend of Willis and Fulton County employee, contradicted that claim, testifying that she had \u201cno doubt\u201d that the Willis-Wade affair began in late 2019. Notably, that would be before Willis hired Wade to lead the Trump probe in late 2021.\n\nBryant-Yeartie said she observed \u201chugging, kissing, close affection\u201d between Willis and Wade prior to 2022, when they claimed their romantic relationship began. She also testified that Willis had told her in 2020 and 2021 that she was dating Wade.\n\nThere was some Clinton-esque parsing of words on whether Wade cheated on his ex-wife by being with Willis. Past filings from Roman\u2019s team salaciously noted that she had been dating \u201ca married man.\u201d\n\nWade testified that his previous marriage was broken since 2015, long before his relationship with Willis began, saying, \u201cMy marriage was irretrievably broken\u201d in 2015, and \u201cI was free to have a relationship.\u201d\n\nWade and Willis describe using cash for reimbursements\n\nWade and Willis have offered a simple explanation for why there\u2019s essentially no paper trail to back up his claims they split expenses: Willis used cash.\n\nCredit card statements submitted in Wade\u2019s divorce proceedings show he paid for two flights for them in recent years, to San Francisco and Miami. They also took lavish trips to Belize, the Bahamas and some Caribbean cruises.\n\nWhen pressed on whether he paid for Willis\u2019 travel when they vacationed together, Wade said that Willis reimbursed him for a flight \u201cin cash.\u201d Wade said he did not have receipts for all of the times Willis reimbursed him for trips \u2013 pushing back against the allegations from the defense side that Willis was essentially getting kickbacks from him in the form of vacations.\n\n\u201cI did not deposit the cash in my account,\u201d Wade replied, smirking at times.\n\nDefense attorney Craig Gillen, who represents one of the fake electors, grilled Wade on what he would do with the cash reimbursements \u2013 in at least one case, thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a single solitary deposit slip to corroborate or support any of your allegations that you were paid by Ms. Willis in cash?\u201d Gillen shot back, raising his voice slightly.\n\n\u201cNo sir,\u201d Wade said, to which Gillen replied: \u201cNot a single solitary one?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a one,\u201d Wade responded.\n\nThere was also a dispute over when the relationship ended, and whether it had any impact on the decision to seek the massive RICO indictment against Trump and others in last August.\n\nBoth said the relationship ended in summer 2023. Willis implied that the physical component ended earlier in the summer, but that the two had a \u201ctough conversation\u201d that fully ended things afterward.\n\nTrump lawyer Steven Sadow asked Willis about the breakup, eliciting an answer that revealed sexist remarks that Wade allegedly made to Willis in the past. She said, he \u201cis used to women that, as he told me one time, \u2018the only thing a woman can do for him is make him a sandwich.\u2019\u201d She explained that this was a part of their breakup \u2013 but it also was a defense to the self-dealing claims against her.\n\n\u201cWe would have brutal arguments about the fact that \u2018I am your equal,\u2019\u201d Willis said. \u201cI don\u2019t need anything from a man \u2013 a man is not a plan. A man is a companion. And so there was tension always in our relationship, which is why I would give him his money back.\u201d\n\nWillis added, \u201cI don\u2019t need anybody to foot my bills.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Sadow asked Wade during his own testimony whether the two had any \u201cpersonal relationship at all\u201d since their relationship ended, saying \u201cand you know what I mean by that.\u201d\n\nWade shot back, asking if Sadow meant \u201cif I had intercourse with the district attorney.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very good friends, probably closer than ever because of these attacks,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re asking me about specific intercourse, the answer is no.\u201d\n\nHuge distraction from the charges against Trump \u2013 for now\n\nNothing that happened Thursday undercut the factual allegations against Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, or the other GOP allies who are accused of trying to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nBut the hearing shifted the conversation away from those allegation and away from Trump\u2019s legal woes for now.\n\nEarlier in the day, a New York judge set the trial date for Trump\u2019s historic first trial, in the hush-money criminal case, for March 25. But by the afternoon, that news was nearly washed away by the jaw-dropping testimony taking place in Atlanta and being beamed across the country on national television. (Unlike the New York case, cameras are allowed in Georgia courtrooms.)\n\nFriday, a separate New York judge is expected to issue his decision in the Trump civil fraud case that\u2019s an existential threat to his business.\n\nState prosecutors want that judge to issue a $370 million fine against Trump, after finding that Trump and his company committed significant fraud against banks and insurers by lying about his net worth and assets. They also want Trump barred from doing business in New York.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen, Jason Morris, Nick Valencia, Hannah Rabinowitz, Maxime Tamsett, Shirin Faqiri, Jim Rogers, Sarah Davis, Eva Roytburg and Fabiana Chaparro contributed to this report.",

        "article_text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin fired off a few intriguing statements during a Wednesday television interview with loyal journalist Pavel Zarubin. Among them was his claim that he would prefer that President Joe Biden win the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nFrida Ghitis CNN\n\nThe remarks brought to mind a long night I spent in Havana, Cuba, listening to Fidel Castro pontificate for endless hours about every topic under the long-faded sun. That was just ahead of the 2000 US election, when then-Vice President Al Gore squared off against then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush.\n\nI asked Castro if there was a candidate he hoped would become the next president of the US. He laughed for a moment and told me that he most certainly did have a preference. But then he explained that he would not tell me because, if Fidel said who he preferred, it would only hurt his candidate.\n\nWas Putin\u2019s answer based on the same calculation?\n\nIn his interview with Zarubin, Putin argued that Biden would be a better fit for Russia \u201cbecause he is a more experienced person, he is predictable [and] he is a politician of an old formation.\u201d The statement is consistent with other comments Putin has made about the current president. After his first summit in Geneva with Biden as president, back in 2021, Putin sounded a similar note. \u201cHe\u2019s a balanced and professional man, and it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s very experienced,\u201d Putin said. \u201cIt seems to me that we did speak the same language.\u201d\n\nDeciphering Putin and his motives is a constant challenge. The former KGB agent is known for playing all manner of mind games. Remember when he met with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and, knowing her fear of dogs, unleashed his giant black Labrador, to Merkel\u2019s bravely-dissimulated terror. He looked supremely satisfied.\n\nIn this latest interview, Putin also had some choice comments about another so-called interview \u2014 more of a propaganda event \u2014 conducted last week by the disgraced former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Carlson was lambasted in the US and Europe not only for his softball interview and his failure to offer even the faintest pushback against Putin\u2019s barrage of falsehoods, but also because he somehow avoided asking question about any of the controversies surrounding a Russian leader who has been formally charged with war crimes.\n\nIf Americans were not pleased, perhaps Carlson expected Putin to be impressed. But on Wednesday, the Russian president was contemptuous. \u201cI honestly thought [Carlson] would be aggressive and ask tough questions.\u201d Putin said he was prepared for that and was hoping for it because \u201cit would give me the opportunity to give tough answers back.\u201d But Carlson \u201cchose a different tactic.\u201d Putin added that he \u201cdidn\u2019t fully enjoy\u201d the interview.\n\nPutin\u2019s psychological games were on display when he sat down with Carlson. At one point, Putin ridiculed him, grinning sarcastically as he noted that Carlson tried to join but was rejected by the CIA. Perhaps he was signaling that he had done some background checking on his interviewer; maybe he was trying to throw him off balance. Whatever it was, Carlson looked dumbfounded, while Putin appeared delighted.\n\nWhether the Russian president would rather have Biden \u2014 who has arrayed a mighty coalition to push back against Russia in its war against Ukraine and has called Putin a war criminal \u2014 or former President Donald Trump, who gushes with praise about the Russian leader and just said he would tell Russia to do \u201cwhatever the hell they want\u201d to any NATO allies who don\u2019t spend enough on defense, doesn\u2019t seem very hard to decipher.\n\nCastro didn\u2019t say because he didn\u2019t want to jinx his preferred candidate. Putin may be trying to jinx the one he wants to lose.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version incorrectly quoted former President Donald Trump as saying he would \"give\" Ukraine to Russia. He said President Joe Biden would \u201cgive\u201d Ukraine to Russia.",

        "article_text": "The CNN Film chronicling the 2020 attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny airs on Saturday 9p ET/PT on CNN, CNNi and is streaming on Max.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nJailed Russian opposition figure and outspoken Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny, who made global headlines when he was poisoned with a nerve agent in 2020, has died aged 47, the Russian prison service said.\n\nThe cause of his reported death remained unclear, but the news drew a forceful reaction from Western leaders Friday, including US President Joe Biden, who pinned the blame on Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying that \u201cwhat has happened to Navalny is yet more proof of Putin\u2019s brutality.\u201d\n\nNavalny had returned to Russia in 2021 from Germany, where he had been treated after being poisoned with Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. On arrival, Navalnvy was swiftly arrested on charges he dismissed as politically motivated.\n\nHe has been incarcerated ever since, with longstanding concerns for his welfare growing more intense after he was transferred to a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe Russian prison service on Friday said Navalny \u201cfelt unwell after a walk\u201d and \u201calmost immediately\u201d lost consciousness. It said it was investigating his \u201csudden death.\u201d\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had been informed of the reports and that it is for doctors to determine the cause of Navalny\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cAs far as we\u2019re aware, in accordance with all the rules, the prison service is carrying out checks and clarifications,\u201d Peskov told reporters. Asked about reports that the death involved a blood clot, he replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Doctors must find it out.\u201d\n\nThe announcement shocked his family and supporters as Navalny had appeared in court via video link as recently as Thursday, joking with the judge about how he was running short of money.\n\nNavalny\u2019s spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, initially said the Putin critic\u2019s lawyer was traveling to Kharp, where Navalny had been held since December. \u201cAs soon as we have any information, we will report it,\u201d Yarmysh wrote on X.\n\nShe later said the reports of Navalny\u2019s death were \u201cmost likely true.\u201d\n\nNavalny\u2019s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, meanwhile, called for Putin to be brought to justice.\n\n\u201cI want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country, with my family, and with my husband,\u201d she said in emotional remarks that prompted a standing ovation at the Munich Security Conference (MSC), adding that she did not have confirmation of her husband\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThey will be brought to justice and this day will come soon.\u201d\n\nAn ambulance crew tried to resuscitate Navalny for more than half an hour on Friday, Labytnang City Hospital told state-run media RIA Novosti. It added the ambulance team reached the prison in less than seven minutes, and doctors reached the patient two minutes later.\n\n\u201cThe doctors who arrived at the scene continued the resuscitation measures that the prison\u2019s doctors had already provided. They carried them out for more than half an hour. However, the patient died,\u201d the agency\u2019s interlocutor said, according to RIA.\n\nLyudmila Navalnaya, Navalny\u2019s mother, told Russian independent news outlet Novaya Gazeta she had last seen her son on February 12 \u2013 four days before his death \u2013 when he had been \u201calive, healthy and cheerful.\u201d She said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any condolences.\u201d\n\nDozens detained\n\nAt least 100 people were detained across the country for attending vigils and rallies for Navalny on Friday, according to OVD-Info, a group that monitors Russian repression.\n\nIn Moscow, a crowd of mourners lay flowers in the snow before a monument to victims of political repression in a growing tribute to the late opposition figure, according to video from the scene.\n\nNavalny was \u201ca symbol of opposition, a symbol of hope for some brighter future for Russia. And there\u2019s a feeling that with his death, this hope dies,\u201d Valeria, a 23-year-old tour guide, told Agence France-Presse in Moscow. \u201cIf there had been still been any hope left, it is even less now than it was before,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf there had been still been any hope left, it is even less now than it was before,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Moscow prosecutor\u2019s office had warned that protesting in the capital\u2019s city center was unauthorized, saying that participation in a \u201cmass event\u201d could lead to arrest.\n\nNavalny returned to Russia from Germany in 2021, after spending months recovering from a poisoning attack. Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not afraid\u2019\n\nNavalny was sentenced to 19 years in prison in August, after he was found guilty of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activists and various other crimes. He was already serving sentences of 11-and-a-half years in a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges he denies.\n\nFour months later, his lawyers said they had lost contact with Navalny, who was believed to be imprisoned in a penal colony about 150 miles east of Moscow.\n\nHe failed to appear at several scheduled court hearings in December. His legal team said on December 22 that he\u2019d been missing for 17 days.\n\nAfter filing 680 requests to locate Navalny, his team announced on December 25 that they had \u201cfound\u201d him more than a thousand miles away at the IK-3 penal colony in Kharp, known as \u201cPolar Wolf.\u201d\n\nNavalny joins a long list of Russian dissidents who died after challenging Putin\u2019s legitimacy. Many questioned why he continued his campaign despite the clear risks to his safety.\n\nNavalany\u2019s reported death comes shortly before Russia\u2019s presidential election, set to take place on March 17, which is widely seen by the international community as little more than a formality that will secure Putin a fifth term in power.\n\nEven from detention, Navalny had continued to agitate against Putin\u2019s government. In one of his final court appearances on February 8, Navalny urged prison service workers to \u201cvote against Putin.\u201d\n\nA fierce Putin critic\n\nNavalny posed one of the most serious threats to Putin during his rule, which has spanned more than two decades. He organized anti-government street protests and used his blog and social media to expose alleged corruption in the Kremlin and in Russian business.\n\nHis struggle earned him global fame when he was poisoned with Novichok in 2020. Navalny was airlifted from the Siberian city of Omsk and arrived comatose at a hospital in Berlin.\n\nA joint investigation by CNN and the group Bellingcat implicated the Russian Security Service (FSB) in Navalny\u2019s poisoning. The investigation found that the FSB toxins team of about six to 10 agents trailed Navalny for more than three years.\n\nNavalny later duped one of the spies, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, into revealing how he was poisoned. He posed as a senior official from Russia\u2019s National Security Council tasked with carrying out an analysis of the poisoning operation, and phoned Kudryavtsev, who provided a detailed account of how the nerve agents was applied to a pair of Navalny\u2019s underpants.\n\nRussia denied involvement in Nalvany\u2019s 2020 poisoning. Putin said at the time that if the Russian security service had wanted to kill Navalny, they \u201cwould have finished\u201d the job.\n\nNavalny, pictured here in Moscow, Russia in 2013, campaigned against alleged corruption in the Kremlin. Dmitry Lovetsky/AP\n\nWestern condemnation of the Kremlin was swift and fierce following news of Navalny\u2019s death.\n\nBiden laid the blame for Navalny\u2019s death at Putin\u2019s feet while speaking to reporters at the White House. \u201cMake no mistake, Putin is responsible for Navalny\u2019s death,\u201d Biden said Friday, adding that the Russian opposition figure was \u201cbrave,\u201d and \u201cwas dedicated to building a Russia where the rule of law existed.\u201d\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia has \u201cserious questions\u201d to answer. \u201cAlexey Navalny has been a strong voice for freedom, for democracy for many years and NATO allies have called for his immediate release for a long time,\u201d Stoltenberg told reporters in Germany ahead of the MSC.\n\nBiden previously told reporters in 2021 that he warned Putin that the consequences would be \u201cdevastating for Russia,\u201d if Navalny died in prison during the US-Russia summit in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nIn his remarks Friday, Biden said the US was \u201ccontemplating what else can be done\u201d to punish Russia in the wake of Navalny\u2019s apparent death. Regarding his 2021 message to Putin, he told reporters, \u201cthat was three years ago. In the meantime they\u2019ve faced a hell of a lot of consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis tragedy reminds us of the stakes of this moment,\u201d Biden added, urging Republicans to agree to a new round of funding for Ukraine in their war against Russia.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Putin must be held accountable for Navalny\u2019s death at a joint news conference in Berlin with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \u201cPutin does not care who dies as long as he stays in his position.\u201d\n\nNavalny was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison during various trials last year.

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nAlexey Navalny once represented an alternative future for Russia: an optimistic, forward-looking place, free of the one-man rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWith the death of the opposition leader in a prison north of the Arctic Circle, Russia\u2019s bleak political landscape is now many shades darker.\n\nIt would be hard to overstate how profoundly Navalny symbolized Putin\u2019s relentless drive to erase the last remnants of political opposition from Russia. During his many years of activism, Navalny and his supporters saw their protest rallies shut down by riot police; their offices raided; and countless arrests that landed activists in jail, or forced out of the country.\n\nNavalny himself paid an extraordinarily high price for his activism. Under constant surveillance by Putin\u2019s security services, Navalny survived a near-lethal poisoning by the nerve agent Novichok, yet defiantly returned to Russia instead of remaining in comfortable exile. He was immediately arrested on his return to Moscow.\n\nAlexei Navalny was immediately detained by Russian authorities on landing in Moscow from Berlin in January 2021. Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat followed was a parody of criminal justice, as Russian prosecutors heaped on charges against Navalny, who continued to rail against Putin. In one court appearance by video link, a gaunt Navalny \u2013 emaciated by a hunger strike \u2013 heaped scorn on the president, saying, \u201cI would like to say that your king is naked, and more than one little boy is shouting about it \u2013 it is now millions of people who are already shouting about it. It is quite obvious. Twenty years of incompetent rule have come to this: there is a crown sliding from his ears,\u201d Navalny said.\n\n\u201cYour naked king wants to rule until the end, he doesn\u2019t care about the country, he is clung to power and wants to rule indefinitely.\u201d\n\nBut even during a brutal tour of Russia\u2019s penal system, Navalny maintained his composure \u2013 and his extraordinary sense of humor. In a post on Telegram in January, he joked about the ghastly music of the pro-war pop-star Shaman being blared over prison loudspeakers at the IK-3 penal colony in Kharp in the Yamal-Nenets region.\n\n\u201cImagine the picture: Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPolar night. In the barracks for punishment in a special regime colony, A. Navalny, sentenced to 19 years in prison, whom Kremlin propaganda has been rinsing for years for participating in Russian protests, has to do exercises to the song \u2018I am Russian,\u2019 which is played for him as educational work for the purpose of correction.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m still not sure that I correctly understand what post-irony and meta-irony are. But if this isn\u2019t it, then what is it?\u201d\n\nMore touchingly, Navalny posted a photo of himself with his wife Yulia on Valentine\u2019s Day, his last post on Telegram.\n\n\u201cBaby, everything is like in a song with you: between us there are cities, the take-off lights of airfields, blue snowstorms and thousands of kilometers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut I feel that you are near every second, and I love you more and more.\u201d\n\nNavalny, right walks with his family to a polling station during the Moscow city Duma elections in 2019. Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNavalny\u2019s death comes as Putin, who has been in power since New Year\u2019s Eve 1999, heads for a fifth term in office. The March presidential election will be an act of political theater: Boris Nadezhdin, the sole candidate opposed to Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, has been barred from running, and the vote will send a message to Russians and to the world: The Russian people are behind Putin, and behind the war on Ukraine. There is no room for giving air to Navalny on state media in the run-up to the election carnival.\n\nThe opposition leader\u2019s death also marks the end of an era for Russia. Navalny had emerged as the most prominent leader of the Russian opposition following the assassination of outspoken Putin critic Boris Nemtsov in 2015, in plain view of the Kremlin. That killing also shook Russian society profoundly, but it was a very different time. At the time of his murder, Nemtsov and his team were investigating the deployment of Russian troops to the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, something the Russian government officially denied.\n\nNow that war is in the open, following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. And Russia has introduced draconian new laws that make it illegal to criticize the military. The massive anti-corruption protests that Navalny once managed to mobilize before the invasion now seem unlikely to reprise in Putin\u2019s lifetime. The investigative articles and videos Navalny and his team once published online \u2013 reaching millions of Russians \u2013 face ever-more stifling digital censorship.\n\nNavalny, his wife Yulia, opposition politician Lyubov Sobol and other demonstrators march in memory of murdered Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov in downtown Moscow on February 29, 2020. Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s response to the death of Navalny, then, will be telling. Putin famously refused to utter Navalny\u2019s name, hinting at the deep unease about the legitimacy Navalny commanded as opposition leader.\n\nAsked in a 2017 press conference about why his government was afraid of competition from Navalny, Putin again refused to utter Navalny\u2019s name, dancing around the matter by referring to \u201cthe figures you mentioned\u201d and \u201cthose you named.\u201d And he made it clear that he saw Russia\u2019s democratic opposition as an existential threat. In his warped retelling, Putin said Navalny was the equivalent of former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili \u2013 or the equivalent of Ukrainians who rallied in Kyiv\u2019s Maidan Square to oppose Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian president, who fled the country in early 2014.\n\n\u201cAbout the figures you mentioned,\u201d he said. \u201cA question about Ukraine was already asked. Do you want dozens of people like Saakashvili running around here? Those you named are a Russian version of Saakashvilis. Do you want such Saakashvilis to destabilise your country? Do you want us to live from one Maidan to the next? To survive attempted coups? We have been through this already. Do you want all this to return?\u201d\n\nNavalny\u2019s response, again, showed his potent sense of humor. \u201cTo my collection of \u2018words used not to say Navalny\u2019 is added \u2018those you named,\u2019\u201d he joked on Twitter.",

He is the author of The Cost of Chaos: The Trump Administration and the World.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know the exact details of jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny\u2019s death, reported Friday by the Russian prison service \u2014 and we may never find the precise truth. But as US Vice President Kamala Harris put it in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, \u201cWhatever story they tell, let us be clear, Russia is responsible.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Russian President Vladimir Putin practices not plausible deniability but implausible deniability when it comes to the deaths of his most prominent critics and rivals. Does anyone seriously think that the plane crash last year near Moscow of the Wagner Group\u2019s leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who had mounted an armed insurrection, was an accident? (The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any involvement.)\n\nWhat we do know is that Putin\u2019s life project is to effectively recreate the KGB state, win the war in Ukraine and Make Russia Great Again. These projects are now intertwined because repression since Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost exactly two years ago has dramatically increased in Russia.\n\nHuman Rights Watch points to the \u201cincreased war censorship, imprisonment of vocal critics, and the crushing of human rights activism.\u201d\n\nAnd what better way to communicate that the Russian opposition is effectively dead, than by silencing its most prominent leader, Navalny, who is as much a well-known dissident in the West as physicist Andrei Sakharov and author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn were during the Soviet era.\n\nHow did Russia, under Putin, get here? One of the most important events in Putin\u2019s life was the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, which was the beginning of the end of the de facto Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. When the Wall fell, Putin was a KGB officer in Dresden in what was then East Germany. The Soviet Union imploded two years later.\n\nThe context for the fall of the Wall and the implosion of the Soviet state was that Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev had been liberalizing the Soviet Union for several years with his policy of \u201cglasnost\u201d or \u201copenness.\u201d Gorbachev had also pulled Soviet troops out of Afghanistan after almost a decade of a bloody war there in 1989, a conflict that the Soviets believed was a quagmire they needed to extricate themselves from.\n\nPutin drew two big lessons from Gorbachev\u2019s rule: The most dangerous moment for an incompetent authoritarian regime is when it begins to liberalize (to paraphrase French historian and politician Alexis de Tocqueville). And the most dangerous thing a Russian leader can do is lose a war as the Romanovs did in World War I, which helped spark the Russian revolution in 1917. Gorbachev\u2019s pulling out of Afghanistan in February 1989 signaled to Eastern Europe that the feared Soviet military was something of a paper tiger, and within nine months, the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nPutin made a point of not attending Gorbachev\u2019s funeral in 2022, signaling his disapproval of Gorbachev\u2019s record and worldview.\n\nBy contrast with Gorbachev, Stalin ruled with an iron fist and was critical to the Allies winning World War II. After more than two decades of rule, the Soviet dictator died in 1953.\n\nIt appears Putin, a close student of his own brand of Russian history, as he showed during Tucker Carlson\u2019s odd recent interview, plans to rule more the way of Stalin than the way of Gorbachev.\n\nAfter all, Putin has essentially fixed the Russian constitution so he can continue seeking election as the country\u2019s leader until 2036.\n\nIndeed, Putin is running for re-election for president in March. Last month, an anti-war candidate Boris Nadezhdin also started running in the presidential election. But as his campaign gained interest, the Putin regime put an end to that just over a week ago. Now Putin will be running largely unopposed.\n\nHow will news of Navalny\u2019s death be received in Russia? Most Russians get their news from Russian television, which is effectively now Kremlin TV. It\u2019s likely that Russian television will be silent about Navalny\u2019s death, choosing instead to tout the Great Leader Putin, who will surely romp to electoral victory next month, content in the knowledge that the man who was his most effective opponent is now dead.\n\nBut the international community need not remain silent. Navalny should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to communicate what this means to the world. This would require the Nobel Committee to change its rules about not making the award posthumously.\n\nStill, it would send a powerful message to Russians and the world \u2014 just as Solzhenitsyn\u2019s Nobel Prize for Literature did in 1970.",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nWhen Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny returned to Russia in 2021, there were many who feared he would face an untimely end. That became a reality on Friday with his death at a brutal Arctic Circle penal colony, where he had been incarcerated.\n\nHe was the most prominent voice of dissent in Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, the lawyer, politician and corruption activist had for years orchestrated massive street protests and famously branded Putin\u2019s United Russia party \u201cthe party of crooks and thieves.\u201d Despite languishing in prison, he denounced the president over Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and advocating anti-war demonstrations across the country.\n\nThe Kremlin has said it is investigating the critic\u2019s death, the circumstances of which were not immediately clear.\n\nWhat is known is that Navalny has joined the apparently ever-growing list of high-profile Russians who have died in mysterious circumstances. From plane crashes, accidental falls from windows to hangings, poisonings and health issues, the fates of some of those who dared to challenge the Kremlin are myriad.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, chief of Russian private mercenary group Wagner, was thrust into the spotlight through his group\u2019s close involvement in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, securing rare victories for the Kremlin. PMC Wagner/Telegram/Reuters\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin, the bombastic mercenary boss \u2013 once one of the country\u2019s most powerful oligarchs and a member of Putin\u2019s trusted inner circle, died in 2023.\n\nSpeculation over Prigozhin\u2019s eventual fate began soon after his march on Russia last summer.\n\nThe Wagner chief may have initially survived the aftermath of his failed insurrection, but many had expressed doubts over his future. After the aborted mutiny, the mercenary leader\u2019s plane mysteriously fell out of the sky in August and he was subsequently confirmed to have died in the crash through genetic testing, Russian authorities said.\n\nThere is no concrete evidence that points to Kremlin involvement and, officially, the cause of the crash is unknown. Russian authorities have launched a criminal investigation.\n\nBill Browder, a Putin critic and the largest foreign investor in Russia before he was expelled from the country in 2005, said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \u201cPutin never forgives and never forgets.\u201d\n\nBoris Nemtsov\n\nRussian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov was gunned down near the Kremlin on February 27, 2015. The killing took place two days before he was supposed to lead an opposition rally. Dmitry Korotayev/Epsilon/Getty Images\n\nBoris Nemtsov, a vocal Kremlin critic who was a deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin, was shot dead in February 2015 as he walked with his girlfriend in central Moscow.\n\nA top official with the Republican Party of Russia/Party of People\u2019s Freedom, a liberal opposition group, he had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin\u2019s government.\n\nAfter his death, opposition leader Ilya Yashin said his friend had been working on a report about Russian troops and their involvement in Ukraine.\n\nIn an interview with Newsweek magazine just hours before his death, Nemtsov said Russia was \u201cdrowning\u201d under Putin\u2019s leadership and was swiftly becoming a fascist state. \u201cDue to the policy of Vladimir Putin, a country with unparalleled potential is sinking, an economy which accumulated untold currency reserves is collapsing,\u201d he said.\n\nNemtsov\u2019s death came two days before he was set to lead an opposition rally in the Russian capital. His killing took place within sight of the Kremlin. In 2017, five Chechen men were handed lengthy prison terms over his death. Many Nemtsov supporters suspected Putin\u2019s administration of involvement.\n\nBoris Berezovsky\n\nBoris Berezovsky leaves London's High Court with his partner Yelena Gorbunova, left, in 2011. Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images\n\nBoris Berezovsky was a colorful character and once powerful Russian businessman who fell out with the Kremlin and fled to England.\n\nHe had accumulated his wealth following the collapse of the Soviet Union, ditching his earlier career as a Moscow math professor and systems analyst for more lucrative enterprises. While a large chunk of his fortune came from the sale of luxury cars, his wealth and political influence skyrocketed when he bought into Russian media.\n\nAfter losing favor with his government, he relocated to Britain where he began agitating against Putin, and even called for a coup to oust the Russian president.\n\nBerezovsky was convicted of fraud and tax evasion in absentia by a Russian court in 2007. He also accused Russia of trying to assassinate him.\n\nBerezovsky was found dead on the bathroom floor of his UK home in 2013 with a noose around his neck. British police said at the time that there were no signs of struggle and suggested the oligarch had taken his own life.\n\nAlexander Perepilichnyy\n\nOver the years, suggestions have emerged of the possible use of a rare plant poison in the death of Russian financier Alexander Perepilichnyy. Obtained by CNN\n\nAlexander Perepilichnyy was a financier who provided evidence of alleged fraud against Russian tax officials. He died suddenly in 2012 aged 44 while jogging back to his home in Surrey, southwest of London.\n\nIt first appeared that the whistle-blower had died of natural causes.\n\nBut in 2015, plant toxicology experts from the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew told a coroner\u2019s court that traces of a rare plant poison \u2013 gelsemium \u2013 were found in his stomach. Two years later, there were suggestions that poison might have been slipped into sorrel soup, a popular Russian dish he had eaten shortly before his death.\n\nHowever, police said later that they found no evidence that he was poisoned.\n\nAt the time of his death, Perepilichnyy was assisting in a case to uncover a multimillion dollar Russian money-laundering operation.\n\nSergei Magnitsky\n\nThe tomb of Sergei Magnitsky is seen in Moscow. Andrey Smirnov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRussian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky died in a Russian prison in 2009.\n\nHe worked for Hermitage Capital, an investment firm run by American-born financier Bill Browder, and helped uncover a $230 million tax fraud and evidence that Russian government officials were involved in carrying it out, and then covering it up.\n\nSoon after he made those revelations public in 2008, Magnitsky was arrested on separate tax fraud charges. He died a year later, while still in pre-trial detention. His family said crucial medical care was withheld, while a Russian presidential human rights commission report found evidence he had been beaten on the very day he died. The Russian government has always maintained that Magnitsky died of heart failure.\n\nIn the US, Browder launched a public campaign for justice, calling on Congress to introduce a law sanctioning individuals in Russia suspected of involvement in Magnitsky\u2019s death and other human rights violations. The Magnitsky Act was passed by lawmakers in 2012.\n\nTwo weeks after the Magnitsky Act was passed, Moscow banned American adoptions of Russian children in apparent retaliation. Both measures are still in place.\n\nAlexander Litvinenko\n\nAlexander Litvinenko is pictured in a London hospital on November 20, 2006, three days before his death. Natasja Weitsz/Getty Images\n\nA British inquiry determined Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic, had been poisoned at a London hotel bar in 2006 by two Russian agents who spiked his green tea with the highly radioactive polonium-210.\n\nLitvinenko \u2013 who died a slow and painful death in the weeks following his poisoning \u2013 always asserted that Putin and the Kremlin were responsible for what had happened to him.\n\n\u201cYou may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life,\u201d he said in a deathbed statement.\n\nThe inquiry, led by judge Robert Owen, said that Putin \u201cprobably approved\u201d the ex-spy\u2019s killing.\n\nThe Kremlin has always denied the accusation and has refused to extradite the two agents accused of the poisoning to Britain.\n\nLitvinenko had worked for the FSB, Russia\u2019s successor agency to the KGB, the former Soviet secret police and intelligence agency. He specialized in tackling organized crime and his last job at the agency, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was heading up its anti-corruption department \u2013 a position that made him many enemies.\n\nAfter leaving the FSB, Litvinenko accused his former employers of orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia\u2019s invasion of Chechnya later that year.\n\nAccording to his widow, Marina Litvinenko, he had started working for Britain\u2019s security services after he went to Britain as a whistleblower in 2000.\n\nAnna Politkovskaya\n\nA 2005 photograph of Russian human rights advocate, journalist and author Anna Politkovskaya in Leipzig, Germany. Jens Schlueter/DDP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA vocal critic of Russia\u2019s war in Chechnya, she was gunned down in the entrance of her Moscow apartment in October 2006. In 2014, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the killing.\n\nAuthorities alleged that an unidentified man asked Lom-Ali Gaitukayev, whom the jury found was a mastermind of the slaying, to kill Politkovskaya in exchange for $150,000 because of her reports of human rights violations and other issues, the Moscow city court said.\n\nThe New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said her work chronicling human rights abuses in Chechnya led to threats against her and angered Russian authorities.\n\nShortly after her death, Putin denied any Kremlin involvement in her killing, saying that Politkovskaya\u2019s \u201cdeath in itself is more damaging to the current authorities both in Russia and the Chechen Republic \u2026 than her activities.\u201d\n\nDrownings, suicides and other unusual deaths\n\nThe list of deceased detractors who may have potentially fallen foul of the Kremlin could fill a book. On the same day Prigozhin was presumed to have been killed, RIA Novosti also reported the recent death of a former Russian security services general.\n\nGen. Gennady Lopyrev \u2013 who supposedly had knowledge of the construction of Putin\u2019s Black Sea residence \u2013 was convicted of bribery offenses in 2017 and had been serving a sentence of 9 years and 8 months. According to RIA Novosti, while in custody he recently \u201csuddenly fell ill\u201d and subsequently died in hospital on August 16. Lopyrev had always maintained his innocence of all charges.\n\nWashington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War labeled Lopyrev\u2019s death \u201csuspicious\u201d and said that its \u201cinsider source claimed Lopyrev was \u201cthe keeper of secrets\u201d related to the construction of Putin\u2019s residence in Gelendzhik, often referred to as \u201cPutin\u2019s Palace.\u201d\n\nIn May, Russia\u2019s Deputy Minister of Science and Higher Education, Pyotr Kucherenko, 46, died while returning from a trip to Cuba, according to the ministry.\n\nAt least 13 high-profile Russian businessmen have reportedly died by suicide or in mysterious circumstances over the past year, six of them tied to Russia\u2019s two largest energy companies, Gazprom and Lukoil. The latter took the rare public position last year of denouncing Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and calling for the end of the conflict.\n\nRussian sausage magnate-turned-lawmaker Pavel Antov died in India in December 2022 after falling from the third floor of his hotel, according to the Indian police. His friend and travel companion Vladimir Budanov died of a heart attack two days earlier, on Antov\u2019s 65th birthday, according to the police. Budanov was 61 years old and had a preexisting heart condition, the police said, adding that they believed Antov\u2019s death was a suicide.\n\nAlexander Buzakov, the head of a major Russian shipyard that specializes in building non-nuclear submarines, also died suddenly in December 2022, Reuters news agency reported, with no cause of death given by the authorities.\n\nAnatoly Gerashchenko, the former rector to the Moscow Aviation Institute, died in an unspecified accident months earlier, according to a statement from the institute.\n\nLukoil chairman Ravil Maganov also died in the same month after falling out of the window of a Moscow hospital, according to TASS. An initial statement from Lukoil had said Maganov \u201cpassed away following a severe illness.\u201d\n\nAlive but neutralized\n\nNot all those who cross the Kremlin meet with an untimely end. But many are ultimately rendered unable to cause further problems for Putin and his government.\n\nNavalny had been one such individual before his sudden death at a Siberian penal colony.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback What the life of Putin nemesis in Arctic penal colony looked like 02:36 - Source: CNN\n\nAnother Kremlin opponent who served time in prison was Mikhail Khodorkovsky. He was released in 2013 after Putin signed a decree pardoning the former oil magnate, who had been convicted of tax evasion and fraud.\n\nFormer Russian spy Sergei Skripal paid a heavy price for turning against the Kremlin. Skripal was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain before he was granted refuge in the UK after a high-profile spy swap in 2010 between the United States and Russia.\n\nIn 2018, he and his daughter Yulia were left in critical condition after being exposed to Novichok near their home in southern England.\n\nThey survived after a long stint in hospital, with Yulia revealing in the weeks after that their rehabilitation had been \u201cslow and extremely painful.\u201d\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated",

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nWater molecules have been detected on the surface of asteroids for the first time, proving that these remnants from the formation of our solar system aren\u2019t just dried-up space rocks.\n\nAstronomers believe that the impact of asteroids crashing into our planet may have helped deliver water and other elements to early Earth, so finding evidence of water on asteroids could support that theory, according to a new study.\n\nThe data was collected from an instrument on the now-retired Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy airborne telescope. Called SOFIA, the infrared telescope flew aboard a Boeing 747SP aircraft modified to fly through the stratosphere above 99% of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which blocks infrared light.\n\nThe Faint Object infraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope, or FORCAST instrument, allowed astronomers to detect water molecules on Iris and Massalia, two asteroids in the main asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Both are more than 223.1 million miles from the sun.\n\nThe findings were published Monday in The Planetary Science Journal.\n\nAstronomers were inspired to use SOFIA to study asteroids after the telescope spotted evidence of water on the moon, said lead study author Dr. Anicia Arredondo, research scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio.\n\nEvidence of hydration had been found on the two asteroids previously by study coauthor Dr. Maggie McAdam, research scientist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, while using a different telescope. But researchers weren\u2019t sure whether water or another molecular compound such as hydroxyl caused the hydration, Arredondo said.\n\n\u201cOur new observations with SOFIA definitively said that what they saw was indeed water,\u201d Arredondo said. \u201cBut these objects are part of the S-class of asteroids, which means they are mostly made of silicates, and up until Dr. McAdam\u2019s results, they were assumed to be completely dry.\u201d\n\nFinding water on dry cosmic surfaces\n\nThe amount of water the team detected was roughly equivalent to that of a 12-ounce bottle of water trapped within a cubic meter of soil, Arredondo said, which is comparable SOFIA\u2019s moon finding. The telescope picked up on the signature of water molecules in one of the largest craters in the moon\u2019s southern hemisphere in 2020.\n\nLike the water found on the lunar surface, \u201con asteroids, water can also be bound to minerals as well as adsorbed to silicate and trapped or dissolved in silicate impact glass,\u201d Arredondo said.\n\nAsteroids are the leftovers from when the planets formed in our solar system. Studying their compositions can tell astronomers where in our cosmic neighborhood the asteroids originated.\n\n\u201cWhen the solar system was forming, different materials formed based on their distance to the Sun because material (farther) from the Sun cooled down faster (than) material nearer to the Sun,\u201d Arredondo said via email. \u201cThat\u2019s why the inner planets like Earth and Mars are made of rock and the outer planets like Neptune and Uranus are made of ice and gas.\u201d\n\nDetecting water on Iris and Massalia can help astronomers trace the history of these particular asteroids, suggesting their formation took place far enough away from the sun to avoid having their water boiled away by heat.\n\nSearching for water across the solar system\n\nThe researchers attempted to look for water on two other asteroids using SOFIA, but the detection was too faint. Now, the team is using the James Webb Space Telescope to zero in on different asteroids and search for water signatures.\n\nWhile the Webb observations are ongoing, Arredondo said the preliminary results have encouraged the team to request time to observe 30 more asteroids using the powerful infrared telescope.\n\n\u201cThe JWST telescope is much larger than the SOFIA telescope, so it can collect data with higher quality, and it can collect data for more asteroids in a shorter amount of time,\u201d Arredondo said. \u201cI hope to be able to observe many different asteroids with JWST to look for this signature of water, and hopefully be able to take inventory of the water in the asteroid belt.\u201d\n\nWebb could help astronomers better understand the distribution of water across the solar system, as well as the composition of different types of asteroids.\n\n\u201cWe really weren\u2019t expecting to find water on these silicate-rich asteroids,\u201d Arredondo said. \u201cMostly when we talk about hydration on asteroids, we are talking about more carbon-rich asteroids, like asteroid Bennu that NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx mission went to. So now I want to look for trends between (the) amount of hydration and composition. I want to know if the carbon-rich asteroids have significantly more water than silicate-rich asteroids, or if they have similar amounts.\u201d",

        "article_text": "The North Celestial Pole swirls above the Georgia Guidestones in Elberton, Georgia, in 2010. (David Manning/Athens-Banner Herald/AP)\n\nElberton, Georgia \u2014 It was a cold morning in the Granite Capital of the World, and the case of the exploding monument was still unsolved. The criminal investigation had resulted in few answers and no arrests. Wayne Mullenix seemed to know more than he was letting on.\n\n\u201cEverybody will tell you that it\u2019s been a hush-hush deal,\u201d he said as we rode in his large white pickup truck toward the place where the stones once stood.\n\nThe Georgia Guidestones were always mysterious, and strangely magnetic, drawing tourists and miscreants alike during their 42-year lifespan. Mullenix thought of them fondly, because he laid their foundation and once owned the red clay on which they were placed. He helped build the Guidestones on behalf of an enigmatic stranger whose real name he never knew.\n\nBefore dawn on July 6, 2022, an explosion shook the walls at the Mullenix house, almost half a mile up the highway. The Guidestones were badly damaged, and would later be demolished. Mullenix took it personally.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI was disappointed to think that somebody would go to the extreme to destroy something that has not hurt anybody one way or the other for 42 years. I mean, it\u2019s been here. Why would you want it to be destroyed?\u201d\n\nMullenix held the steering wheel in his weathered hands and drove north toward Guidestones Road. He\u2019d agreed to show me around as I examined the two intertwined mysteries of the Guidestones: who built them, and who blew them up.\n\nBut as I learned, one of those mysteries was not really a mystery anymore. And its revelation would put the story of the Guidestones in a harsh new light.\n\nThey were a hush-hush deal since the beginning, because the man who commissioned them used a false name, and this secrecy caused suspicion. There was also a certain hubris about him. This man said he was a Christian \u2014 in fact, the fake last name he used was Christian \u2014 which meant he would have known the Old Testament story about Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments. The sacred words on those stone tablets were said to be inscribed by the finger of God.\n\nIn spite of this knowledge, or perhaps inspired by it, the mystery man would endeavor to write 10 new guidelines for all humankind. And have them inscribed in stone. In eight languages. On vertical slabs of Pyramid Blue granite in a field outside Elberton.\n\nThe first of these new principles, unveiled on a spring day in 1980 before Wayne Mullenix and various other local dignitaries, instructed the reader to \u201cMaintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.\u201d\n\nThe global population was then about 4.5 billion. Following the stranger\u2019s first proposal would have required a population reduction of almost 90 percent.\n\nAs I looked into the backstory of the Guidestones\u2019 pseudonymous creator, known as Robert Christian or R.C. Christian, I learned that he\u2019d published a book in 1986 under his fictitious name. This book, \u201cCommon Sense Renewed,\u201d was said to explain his plan for humanity. The book was rare and elusive. No copies were available on Amazon, nor at any of my local libraries. I saw it listed in the holdings of Ave Maria University in Florida and searched for it there. Neither I nor a librarian could find the book in the stacks. Later, a supervisor called me to say it had disappeared.\n\nI kept looking until I found another copy listed in the online catalogue of an obvious place: the public library in Elberton. It wasn\u2019t on the shelf there either, but when I asked a librarian, she retrieved it from a room behind the desk. The book had a hard gray-blue cover, with the title and author\u2019s name in gold lettering. I opened it and began to read.\n\nThe man behind the Guidestones was troubled by \u2018overpopulation\u2019\n\n\u201cI am the originator of the Georgia Guidestones and the sole author of its inscriptions,\u201d Christian wrote. \u201cI have had the assistance of a number of other American citizens in bringing the monument into being. We have no mysterious purpose or ulterior motives. We seek common sense pathways to a peaceful world, without bias for particular creeds or philosophies. Yet our message is in some areas controversial. I have chosen to remain anonymous in order to avoid debate and contention. Our guides must stand on their own merits.\u201d\n\nThe 10 guidelines included a call for a \u201cworld court\u201d to resolve \u201cexternal disputes,\u201d and a \u201cliving, new language\u201d to \u201cunite humanity.\u201d Christian laid out other plans that limited individual rights. Potential voters should be subjected to testing on economics and history, he wrote, and they should have to show \u201cevidence of economic productivity.\u201d Healthcare should not be seen as unlimited, and some people should get preferential treatment.\n\n\u201cIt will be necessary for well informed citizens to work with knowledgeable physicians in establishing guidelines that will make possible a reasonable allocation or \u2018rationing\u2019 of the care we can collectively afford,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfavoring those individuals whose continuing lives are most valuable to society at large.\u201d\n\nThis theme of valuing some lives more than others continued as Christian explored one of his favorite topics: reducing the global population.\n\n\u201cWe establish social environments in which many talented and productive individuals are constrained to limit their reproduction,\u201d Christian wrote, \u201cwhile at the same time we provide subsidies that encourage childbearing by the indigent, the lazy, the irresponsible and the inadequate.\u201d\n\nChristian hoped for drastic changes on this front. \u201cIt is vitally important that each national government have a considered \u2018Population Policy,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201c\u2026A few generations of single child families will make possible dramatic improvements of living standards in even the most impoverished countries.\u201d\n\nIn Christian\u2019s view, only one notable country had already begun to address the problem: \u201cNo major power except China has indicated an awareness of the problems of overpopulation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear precisely what Christian knew or believed about China\u2019s one-child policy when he wrote the book. More details would emerge after the policy ended in 2015. In 2019, Chinese-American filmmaker Nanfu Wang released \u201cOne Child Nation,\u201d a documentary film about life in China under the one-child policy. Wang returned to her hometown in Jiangxi Province to interview people there.\n\n\u201cSterilization takes 10 minutes,\u201d Huaru Yuan, the midwife who delivered Wang as a baby, said in the film. \u201cOn my operating table, I\u2019d do over 20 a day. In those days, women were abducted by government officials, tied up, and dragged to us like pigs.\u201d\n\nSome babies were thrown away like trash. Some were taken by human traffickers. Parents left some in marketplaces, hoping they\u2019d be rescued by strangers. Nanfu Wang\u2019s mother told of helping her younger brother get rid of his daughter so he\u2019d have permission to try for a son.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t discard the baby in broad daylight, so we carried her in a basket, climbed over mountains when it was still dark out,\u201d Zaodi Wang said. \u201cWe put $20 in her clothes and left her on the meat counter in the market. For two days and two nights, she was there. No one wanted her....She eventually died.\u201d\n\nThe Guidestones were often under attack by vandals\n\nElberton is in the rural South, about 100 miles east-northeast of Atlanta, in the multi-state cultural region that is sometimes called the Bible Belt. Given this setting, I had certain preconceived notions about how local officials might view the messages of Robert Christian and the Georgia Guidestones. Those notions turned out to be wrong.\n\nI asked Elbert County Commission Chairman Lee Vaughn what he thought about the directive to keep the global population under 500 million.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t read into that and think genocide.\u201d\n\nAs I sat in Wayne Mullenix\u2019s truck near the empty and unadorned field that once held the Guidestones, I asked him the same question. Did he agree with their first guideline?\n\n\u201cKnowing what I know today, I think that was a good message,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got too many people in this world right now.\u201d\n\nLater, after reading Robert Christian\u2019s book, I asked Mullenix about some of its passages. I read him the part about \u201cchildbearing by the indigent, the lazy, the irresponsible and the inadequate.\u201d The part about how every government should have a population policy. The part about how China was addressing overpopulation. The part about how living standards in poor countries could be raised by a few generations of single-child families.\n\nMullenix did not object to any of that.\n\n\u201cWell, I mean, that makes sense to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve got one child.\u201d\n\nOther people did object to the message of the Guidestones. And the monument had been under attack for years, whether for ideological reasons or the primitive desire to break stuff. It was such a magnet for vandalism and other criminal activity that local authorities installed surveillance cameras whose footage could be monitored from the dispatch center. Sheriff\u2019s reports described a series of incidents.\n\nIn 2013, a caretaker reported that \u201csomeone wrote with a black marker on the Georgia Guidestones\u201d and \u201cit looked like someone tried to dig around the base of another column.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, a deputy found the Guidestones defaced with spray paint. Alongside a vulgar message were the words \u201cYOU WON\u2019T WIN.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, a deputy found people shooting a rap video at the Guidestones. They had doused the stones with fake blood.\n\nThe explosion happened shortly after a political candidate called for the Guidestones\u2019 destruction\n\nOn May 1, 2022, Kandiss Taylor, an educator and Republican gubernatorial candidate from Appling County, stood on the debate stage with Governor Brian Kemp and said, \u201cThis governor failed us in Georgia.\u201d The next day she posted a link on Facebook to a campaign video about her proposed EXECUTIVE ORDER #10.\n\nThe video featured ominous music and drone footage of the Guidestones. Taylor drew a connection between Covid-19 vaccines and the inscription calling for the global population to be kept under 500 million. She compared abortion to human sacrifice associated with the worship of demons. She said it was a \u201cwar between good and evil.\u201d This was her proposed executive order: DEMOLISH THE GEORGIA GUIDESTONES.\n\nSixty-five days later, in the darkness outside Elberton, there was an explosion.\n\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation released surveillance video that showed what it said was \u201can unknown person leaving an explosive device at the Georgia Guidestones.\u201d This clip had no visible timestamp, unlike the two other clips released after the incident, and the figure was so small and grainy that identification seemed unlikely. Another clip showed the blast knocking down one of the columns and propelling shards of granite across the field. A third clip showed a silver car apparently leaving the scene.\n\nSurveillance footage released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation shows an explosion at the Guidestones in 2022. (Georgia Bureau of Investigation)\n\nThe explosion did not bring down all the Guidestones. But the authorities finished the job. A GBI statement said its officials \u201cmade the call to demolish the entire structure since someone destroyed one of the five vertical slabs that held the structure up. This weakened structure created an unsafe environment for investigators to search.\u201d\n\nSince then, new information has been scarce. The GBI declined to release any documents to me or make investigators available for interviews. A spokesperson did not answer my questions on the case, including what kind of explosive was used and why the clip of the \u201cunknown person\u201d did not show a timestamp. Lee Vaughn, the county commission chairman, told me the GBI\u2019s investigation had lost momentum.\n\n\u201cI really think it\u2019s a religious zealot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had that lady running for governor, I can\u2019t remember her name, that said they were of Satan and had to come down.\u201d\n\nWayne Mullenix also wondered aloud about Kandiss Taylor, the woman who pledged to demolish the Guidestones. She\u2019d gotten barely 3 percent of the vote in the primary election, so she did not become governor, but her name surfaced again after the explosion, when she was the victim of a swatting incident.\n\nOn July 11, 2022, local authorities received a call that seemed to originate from Taylor\u2019s home in Baxley, about 200 miles southeast of Atlanta. Someone told a dispatcher that \u201ca female has shot a male subject 5 times in the chest and that she was saying that she was going to kill herself,\u201d according to a sheriff\u2019s report. At least four law-enforcement officials approached the Taylor house. Eventually Taylor opened the door to the deputies, who checked the house and found that no one had been shot. The call had been a malicious hoax. The case was turned over to the GBI, which has yet to arrest anyone.\n\nTaylor did not agree to an interview with me, but she did answer some of my text messages. When I asked about the Guidestones, she wrote,\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that satanic monument is gone.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked if she\u2019d been questioned by the GBI, she didn\u2019t reply. And when I asked if she was involved in destroying the Guidestones, or knew who was, she wrote:\n\n\u201cMr. Lake, an act of God took those cursed Guidestones down, and if you cared more about actual journalism rather than harassing me, you would be out there investigating the maniac who erected that genocidal monument overnight in the first place.\u201d\n\nTaylor has been quoted repeating a claim from a YouTube video that lightning caused the explosion. I ran this claim past three experts.\n\nResearch scientist Christopher Sterpka of the Georgia Tech Research Institute watched the video on the lightning theory and then wrote back to me, \u201cJust from a cursory glance at the low-res video, there are hints of a lightning event. There is a slight blue \u2018glow\u2019 at the same time as the brightness surge of the lamp in the background in two of the frames \u2026 corresponding to the start of the explosion.\u201d\n\nBut Sterpka could find no record that lightning had struck at that time and location. Thus, he told me, \u201cIt\u2019s not really enough to say this was a lightning strike.\u201d\n\nSteve Wistar, a senior forensic meteorologist for AccuWeather, said he doubted the lightning theory because he could find no evidence of a strike at that place and time. Nor could Chris Vagasky, lightning data specialist with the National Lightning Safety Council.\n\n\u201cThe National Lightning Detection Network detected no lightning within 27 miles of the monument any time between 3 am and 5 am on July 6, 2022,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo while lightning can cause damage to granite and rock monoliths, it did not do so in this case.\u201d\n\nIn the truck with Wayne Mullenix, I asked if he\u2019d heard any theories about the explosion.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some things that I just can\u2019t repeat,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, and, I can\u2019t \u2014 those things, I won\u2019t tell you or anybody.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d come to town looking for clues to two mysteries. Who blew up the Guidestones? It seemed that one would remain unsolved for now. But as for who built them, well, that was another story.\n\nAn Elberton banker may have unwittingly revealed the truth\n\nAs we sat in his truck near Guidestones Road, I asked Wayne Mullenix if he knew who Robert Christian really was.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI never asked. It wasn\u2019t anything I wanted to know.\u201d\n\nAt least one local man knew. A banker named Wyatt Martin needed to know Mr. Christian\u2019s real identity to manage the financial transactions for the building of the Guidestones. He promised never to disclose Christian\u2019s real name.\n\n\u201cWhen I'm dead and gone,\u201d he said in 2010, \u201cnobody will ever know who put it there.\u201d\n\nMartin died in 2021 at age 91. But late in his life, he may have accidentally revealed the truth about Robert Christian.\n\nAbout three decades after the Guidestones were unveiled, a documentary film crew visited Elberton. Their film, \u201cDark Clouds Over Elberton,\u201d was released in 2015. It has drawn almost no news coverage. I searched its title in the Nexis and Newspapers.com databases. Both searches returned zero results.\n\nBut this little-known film contains major revelations.\n\nThe filmmakers went to see Wyatt Martin, keeper of the secret, to see what he might tell them. Martin had a trove of documents related to Robert Christian and the Guidestones. He said Christian had asked him to destroy them, but he kept them, thinking he might someday write a book. Now he was getting old, and it was too late to write a book, but the documents were still there, in an old computer case in his shed.\n\n\u201cWould you be willing to show it to us?\u201d asked the director, Christian J. Pinto.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Martin said, smiling. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to open it,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cWould you be willing to just show us the case?\u201d\n\nAfter some further persuasion, Martin went to a shelf, got a key, and walked outside. The filmmakers followed, camera rolling. Producer J. Michael Bennett later recalled this moment in an interview with me. He thought they might be about to find something big. Martin unlocked the door to the shed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heavy,\u201d he said to Bennett, who was on his knees, re-arranging items and looking for the old computer case.\n\n\u201cI love history,\u201d Bennett said, \u201cand this is a part of history.\u201d\n\nBennett pulled out the old brown case and brought it into the light. When he asked Martin if perhaps it belonged in a museum, Martin said no, he wouldn\u2019t give it to a museum, because then he might reveal Robert Christian\u2019s secret identity.\n\n\u201cI might have his address and name in there,\u201d Martin said. \u201cProbably do.\u201d\n\nThe negotiation continued. Bennett gently pushed the boundaries, and Martin jovially pushed back. From behind the camera, Pinto asked if they could open the case. Martin gave in.\n\n\u201cYou might turn that case down,\u201d he said, instructing Bennett to set the case on its side. \u201cIf it\u2019ll still open.\u201d\n\nBennett undid the two latches and opened the case, revealing a rumpled stack of papers and envelopes.\n\n\u201cThat is a letter right there from Mr. R.C. Christian,\u201d Martin said. He held it up for the camera, showing that it was addressed to him. There was no return address. Intentionally or not, his thumb covered the postmark.\n\nMartin took out the letter and began to read.\n\n\u201cSee, he says, \u2018I believe that the message of the Guidestones will not receive adequate attention until the problems of human overpopulation become more critical. In the meantime, there is little more that we two can do to spread their message. Hopefully, the monument will endure long enough to help direct attention to the core issues.\u201d\n\nMartin showed the letter to the camera. It was dated July 14, 1998.\n\n\u201cI am old enough (78) to remembers the days of the \u2018Dust Bowl,\u2019\u201d Robert Christian wrote. He mentioned that he\u2019d recently had open-heart surgery. He had recovered well, he wrote, but added, \u201cI am reminded of my own mortality.\u201d\n\nAs the conversation continued, Martin let down his guard a little more. Bennett picked up a letter from Christian and showed it to the camera. This time the postmark was visible. It said Fort Dodge, Iowa.\n\nThe camera scanned over the papers. It caught another envelope, from another letter addressed to Martin. This one did have a visible return address.\n\nIs this the mystery man behind the Guidestones?\n\nHere are three reasons to believe that the man who commissioned the Georgia Guidestones was Herbert H. Kersten, a physician from Fort Dodge, Iowa:\n\n1. Kersten was born on May 7, 1920, and thus would have been 78 on July 14, 1998, the date of the letter in which Robert Christian said he was 78.\n\n2. Kersten lived for many years at the same address seen on one of the envelopes sent to Wyatt Martin.\n\n3. Kersten wrote a lot of letters that were published in newspapers, and in those letters he sounded strikingly similar to Robert Christian.\n\n\u201cMost important of all, America should now begin to direct the attention of the world to solving the fundamental problem which threatens to engulf all humanity in social and economic catastrophe,\u201d Herbert H. Kersten, M.D. wrote in a letter published by the Des Moines Register on January 25, 1981, less than a year after the Guidestones were unveiled. \u201cI refer to the uncontrolled reproduction of our species, which has already caused human numbers to far exceed the level which our planet can support in decency.\u201d\n\n\u201cRational planning of human reproduction is becoming increasingly essential,\u201d Kersten wrote in a letter the Register published in 1990.\n\n\u201cContrary to widespread opinion,\u201d Kersten wrote in a 1996 letter to the editor, \u201cour nation is now overpopulated.\u201d\n\nWhen the filmmakers visited Fort Dodge, the story took a darker turn.\n\nDigging further into the doctor\u2019s background, they interviewed local historian Roger Natte and William Sayles Doan, an art patron and author who said he knew Kersten. Doan, who died in 2015, said Kersten used to brag about his friendship with William Shockley, the Nobel Prize-winning inventor who later became a notorious eugenicist.\n\n\u201cI mean, he did not make it a secret,\u201d Doan said in the film, referring to Kersten\u2019s connection with Shockley. \u201cHe was proud of it.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, when David Duke ran for president, Kersten put in a good word for him \u2014 even though Duke was an infamous Klansman and neo-Nazi.\n\n\u201cDavid Duke voices many beliefs held by reasonable Americans,\u201d Kersten wrote in a letter published by the Des Moines Register.\n\nIf Kersten knew Shockley \u2014 a claim from Doan that I was unable to independently confirm \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be surprising that he supported Duke. One of Duke\u2019s books, \u201cMy Awakening,\u201d is dedicated to \u201cmy friend, William Shockley,\u201d who \u201ccrusaded for our heritage.\u201d\n\nWhether or not he was actually Herbert Kersten, the man known as Robert Christian compared humanity to a \u201cfleet of overcrowded lifeboats.\u201d He wrote that distribution of medical care should tilt toward \u201cfavoring those individuals whose continuing lives are most valuable to society at large.\u201d He was the one who envisioned a better world, a more rational world, a world in which four billion unwanted people have simply disappeared.\n\nOfficials in Elberton confront the documentary\u2019s findings\n\nDid the producers of \u201cDark Clouds Over Elberton\u201d unmask the man behind the Georgia Guidestones? Producer J. Michael Bennett told me he was not aware of any serious challenge to the film\u2019s accuracy. Herbert Kersten died in 2005, and it wasn\u2019t certain that he agreed with Shockley on race and eugenics or whether he changed any of his views later in life. I reached out to Kersten\u2019s children, hoping for insight, but managed to speak with only one: former Iowa State Senator James Kersten. In a brief phone conversation, I asked Kersten about his father\u2019s possible connection to the Georgia Guidestones.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not familiar with that,\u201d Kersten said.\n\nI asked if he had seen the film \u201cDark Clouds Over Elberton.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t listen to a lot of that crap,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I really don\u2019t have anything to say, so thank you.\u201d\n\nIn interviews with me, Elberton\u2019s leaders were not eager to grapple with what the filmmakers found. They did not know Herbert Kersten.\n\nMayor Daniel Graves first said he\u2019d never watched \u201cDark Clouds Over Elberton,\u201d and then said he\u2019d seen part of it, and then dismissed it as some \u201chogwash thing.\u201d Finally, he said the views of such people as Shockley and Duke \u201chave absolutely no place in our community.\u201d\n\nLee Vaughn, chairman of the Elbert County Commission, said he had watched the film.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just sensationalism,\u201d he said, but didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nWhen I asked if the filmmakers found the truth, he said, \u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\nWayne Mullenix was interviewed for the film, and said he had watched it. When I asked if he thought its conclusions were accurate, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. And it didn\u2019t bother me one way or the other.\u201d\n\nIt was obviously unpleasant to imagine that the Granite Capital\u2019s most famous granite monument was commissioned by someone who bragged about his friend the eugenicist and wrote favorably about a Klansman and neo-Nazi. As I finished writing this story, I called Lee Vaughn again and put the question to him explicitly: If these allegations are true, does it change how you feel about the Georgia Guidestones?",

        "article_text": "CNN \u2014\n\nOn Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a new, first-of-its-kind therapy that could help patients with metastatic melanoma, a rare but deadly form of skin cancer.\n\nThe drug, made by the California-based Iovance Biotherapeutics, is approved to treat patients for whom other medicines have failed and the skin cancer is unable to be removed with surgery, or the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.\n\nAmtagvi, as the treatment is called, is the first cellular therapy used to treat this form of solid tumor cancer. The company said the drug will be made in Philadelphia with the capacity to help up to \u201cseveral thousand patients annually.\u201d\n\nThe therapy works by using a person\u2019s own immune cells to fight the cancer. With this treatment, doctors will remove tissue from the patient\u2019s tumors and then take its immune cells and grow them in the lab. Once there are enough immune cells, doctors then give them back to the patient in an infusion and the immune cells go on to overwhelm and destroy the cancer.\n\nPatients only need to receive the treatment once for it to work \u2014 and it can work for years, said Dr. Ryan Sullivan, the associate director of the Melanoma Program at Mass General Cancer Center. The center was a site for one of the trials with the new therapy, which was evaluated at several centers around the world.\n\nIn the trials, the FDA said that \u201camong the 73 patients treated with Amtagvi at the recommended dose, the objective response rate was 31.5%, including three (4.1%) patients with a complete response and 20 (27.4%) patients with a partial response. Among patients who were responsive to the treatment, 56.5%, 47.8% and 43.5% continued to maintain responses without tumor progression or death at six, nine and 12 months, respectively.\u201d\n\nThe FDA said the treatment will carry a boxed warning to inform patients that the treatment can cause a severe low blood count, severe infection and cardiovascular problems.\n\nOther risks associated with the treatment relate to the surgery associated with the treatment and with seven days of intensive chemotherapy that the patient will need before receiving the treatment.\n\nThe company says the other side effects can include chills, fever, tiredness, a fast heart rate, diarrhea, fever, rash and hair loss. Most side effects clear up in the first few weeks. Despite the risks, doctors say the benefits for patients could be enormous.\n\n\u201cWith this, it\u2019s not just that patients will live an extra two or three weeks, it\u2019s that these patients may be cured with the treatment, or at the very least, they may have controlled the disease and that will last for two, three, four years and beyond,\u201d said Sullivan, who is also an associate professor at Harvard Medical School said. \u201cThat\u2019s really exciting.\u201d\n\nLong-term follow-up studies will be needed to show how long the treatment can last.\n\nAbout 100,640 new melanomas will be diagnosed every year according to the American Cancer Society and more than 8,000 people in the US die from melanoma every year. This cancer makes up only 1% of skin cancer cases, but accounts for many of the deaths related to skin cancer.\n\n\u201cMelanoma is a life-threatening cancer that can cause devastating impacts to affected individuals, with a significant risk of metastasizing and spreading to other areas in the body,\u201d said Dr. Nicole Verdun, director of the Office of Therapeutic Products in the Center of Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cToday\u2019s approval reflects the FDA\u2019s dedication and commitment to the development of innovative, safe and effective treatment options for cancer patients.\u201d\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nResearch suggests that this approach to treating cancer may be useful to treat other hard-to-fight cancers too.\n\n\u201cGiven the significant unmet needs in the advanced melanoma community, we are proud to offer a personalized, one-time therapeutic option for these patients,\u201d said Dr. Frederick Vogt, interim chief executive officer and president of Iovance. \u201cWe are continuing our development efforts to address additional unmet medical needs in patients with solid tumor cancers, making our novel cell therapies available to more patients with melanoma and other types of cancers.\u201d\n\nSullivan, who treats melanoma patients in Massachusetts, said Friday\u2019s FDA announcement will come as good news.\n\n\u201cWhile patients with melanoma have a lot more treatment options than they had 15 years ago, we still have a lot of our patients who are diagnosed with metastatic melanoma dying,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good day to have another option, particularly an option in a population of patients where our standard therapies have failed them.\u201d",

The linked OnlyFans account, updated as recently as February 14, blocks images for non-subscribers but contains identifying information and captions alluding to adult and \u201cnude\u201d content.\n\n\u201cWelcome to my OnlyFans page, where I post creative content and give fans a more intimate look into my life,\u201d the page reads.\n\nJulie Farbarik, the district\u2019s director of alumni & community relations, told CNN affiliate KVOA that the posts are \u201ccontrary to our district\u2019s \u2018Use of Social Media by District Employees\u2019 policy and our staff ethics policy.\u201d Farbarik also confirmed Dolezal\u2019s termination.\n\nCNN has reached out to Dolezal for comment.\n\nDolezal made headlines in 2015 when it was revealed that, despite leading the Spokane chapter of the NAACP and claiming a detailed heritage as a person of color, Dolezal\u2019s parents were both White with European ancestry. In the ensuing media storm, Dolezal never denied her White heritage, but claimed that she still \u201cidentifies as Black.\u201d\n\nRachel Dolezal, then a leader of the Human Rights Education Institute, stands in front of a mural she painted at the institute's offices in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, on July 24, 2009. Nicholas K. Geranios/AP\n\nDolezal\u2019s enduring media presence prompted cantankerous conversations about identity and race. In a 2017 CNN interview, she said she believes race is a \u201csocial construct.\u201d\n\nDespite widespread derision, Dolezal did not shed her assumed identity after her actual heritage was revealed. In 2016, she legally changed her name to Nkechi Amare Diallo. The name Nkechi is a shortened Igbo name of Nigerian origin, and means \u201cgift of God.\u201d\n\nShe said at the time she would continue to use the name Rachel Dolezal as well, and the names appear to alternate on her various social media accounts. Her apparent OnlyFans account bears the name Rachel Dolezal.\n\nOnlyFans is a social media platform where creators post photos and videos and can charge users a fee to access it. It is typically known as a place for explicit content.\n\nIts rising popularity has led to innumerable instances of people being fired from their jobs for being OnlyFans creators, including several teachers. Such incidents have raised questions about employment discrimination, the stigma of sex work and the effects of the gig economy.\n\nA 2017 profile of Dolezal in The Guardian claimed that, at the time, Dolezal was \u201cjobless\u201d and \u201cfeeding her family with food stamps\u201d while being offered opportunities only in \u201creality TV and porn.\u201d\n\nHowever, Dolezal has continued to crop up in the public eye. In 2017, she published a memoir titled \u201cIn Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World.\u201d She also promotes her art on social media and produces a podcast called \u201cPeripheries.\u201d The podcast\u2019s description says the show\u2019s logo was created by Dolezal and depicts Josephine Beall Willson Bruce, a Black women\u2019s rights activist from the late 1800s and early 1900s and \u201ca multicultural historical figure who was often perceived as white.\u201d",

        "article_text": "New York CNN \u2014\n\nYou\u2019re not imagining it: Gasoline prices are moving swiftly higher across the country.\n\nThe national average has climbed 11 cents in the past week alone, to $3.28 a gallon, according to AAA. That means millions of Americans hitting the roads this Presidents\u2019 Day weekend will be greeted by the highest prices in nearly three months.\n\nSome of this jump in pump prices is normal. Gas prices always rise as winter winds down because demand increases and gas stations must switch over to more expensive summer fuel.\n\nSome of this jump is abnormal. Refinery outages \u2014 including a weekslong shutdown of the largest refinery in the Midwest \u2014 are limiting the supply of gas.\n\nNo matter the cause, rising gas prices are bad news for consumers already frustrated by the cost of living.\n\nAnd this trend could cause headaches for officials in Washington \u2014 especially if it accelerates. Higher gas prices complicate the Federal Reserve\u2019s war on inflation. And they undercut the election year message of a White House that previously pointed to cheap gas prices as evidence that Bidenomics is working.\n\nThe higher prices go, the bigger the headaches.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive subject for Americans,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \u201cThe White House is somewhat powerless. The president doesn\u2019t really deserve credit or blame. The market will do what it\u2019s going to do.\u201d\n\nWhy gas prices rise as winter ends\n\nGas prices bottomed at $3.07 a gallon nationally on January 15. Since then, the national average has increased by 21 cents to $3.28 on Friday.\n\nSo far, this is well within what\u2019s considered normal. De Haan said that over the past decade, gas prices have increased by between 35 and 85 cents a gallon between the winter low and the spring-summer peak.\n\nThis happens for good reasons.\n\nFirst, oil prices \u2014 the main driver of retail gas prices \u2014 tend to increase during this time of the year. That\u2019s true again now. US crude has increased by about $10 since mid-December, to $78 a barrel today.\n\nInvestors know that demand for fuel increases as people drive more often and take road trips in warmer weather.\n\n\u201cJanuary and February are the lowest gas demand months,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates. \u201cWe are moving into higher demand months. That should be no surprise. It\u2019s been this way for 50 years.\u201d\n\nAnother annual tradition: Gas stations switch over to more expensive summer blends of fuel. That transition has already happened in Southern California \u2014 a switch that can add about 30 cents a gallon to gas prices.\n\nRefinery troubles\n\nAt the same time, refineries often shut down for regularly scheduled maintenance late in the winter and early in the spring. Those shutdowns limit how much oil the refinery system can turn into gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.\n\nWhat\u2019s complicated matters this winter is there have been some unscheduled refinery outages.\n\nMost notably, BP\u2019s Whiting refinery in northwest Indiana has been shut down for weeks. That\u2019s a big deal because this refinery is not just BP\u2019s largest in the world, it\u2019s the biggest in the Midwest. BP says Whiting can produce enough gasoline each day to support the average daily travel of 7 million cars.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence then, that states in the Midwest have experienced the biggest price spikes.\n\nOver the past month, gas prices have surged by 47 cents in Ohio, 40 cents in Indiana and 36 cents in Illinois, according to AAA.\n\nRefinery outages in the Rocky Mountain region \u2014 which includes Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico \u2014 have also helped drive up the price of gas there. In the past week, gas has risen by 26 cents in New Mexico and by 21 cents in Colorado, according to the driving club.\n\nA series of refinery closures in recent decades has made the country more vulnerable to unexpected outages \u2014 including those caused by extreme weather. For instance, without the usual backstop, last summer\u2019s historic heatwave that knocked some refineries offline unexpectedly lifted gas prices across the country.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that while gas prices have gone up sharply in recent weeks, it\u2019s cheaper to fill up than it was a year ago. The national average for regular gas stood at $3.42 a gallon at this point last year.\n\nHow high will they go?\n\nLooking ahead, experts are confident gas prices will continue to rise \u2014 but likely at a slower pace.\n\nAs long as there are no major surprises, Lipow expects the national average will peak at between $3.50 and $3.75 a gallon this summer. That\u2019s a far cry from the unprecedented spike above $5 a gallon in June 2022.\n\n\u201cThere is more than adequate crude oil supply \u2014 unless we get a major disruption due to tensions spreading throughout the Middle East,\u201d Lipow said.\n\nIf the Israel-Hamas war spreads and derails supply from Iran and Saudi Arabia, prices would likely spike.\n\nGasBuddy\u2019s De Haan expects the national average will hit $3.50 a gallon by March or April. But he doesn\u2019t see gas prices hitting $4 a gallon this year \u2014 unless something goes wrong.\n\n\u201cA refinery outage here or an Arab Spring there could cause prices to go up a lot more,\u201d he said.",
