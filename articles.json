    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nDonald Trump owes the state of New York more than $350 million in damages for decades of fraudulent business practices, a New York State Supreme Court judge ruled Friday.\n\nThe former president was also barred, under Judge Arthur Engoron\u2019s ruling, from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation or other legal entity in New York for three years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s two elder sons, Eric and Donald Jr., are also banned from serving as executives for New York companies for two years. Both were hit with $4 million fines.\n\n\u201cTheir complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,\u201d the ruling states. \u201cThey are accused only of inflating asset values to make more money. The documents prove this over and over again.\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, center, sits in the courtroom before the start of closing arguments in his civil business fraud trial at New York Supreme Court on Jan. 11. The New York judge ruled against Trump on Friday. via Associated Press\n\nTrump\u2019s business empire was not ordered to be dissolved, as the judge previously indicated would happen. The court instead said any restructuring or dissolution of any LLC will be subject to individual review by a court-appointed director of compliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ruling also hit two former Trump associates, Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney. They were permanently banned from having financial control over any New York corporation or similar business entity in New York. Weisselberg, who last year served time for tax evasion, previously served as chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and McConney was Trump\u2019s corporate controller.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is overwhelming that Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney cannot be entrusted with controlling the finances of any business,\u201d the ruling states.\n\nThe defendants were dismissed by the judge for denying reality throughout the trial and refusing to accept responsibility or take action to prevent future wrongdoing.\n\nTrump's two elder sons, Eric Trump, left, and Donald Trump Jr., were each fined $4 million and banned from serving as executives for New York companies for two years. via Associated Press\n\n\u201cThey did not rob a bank at gunpoint. Donald Trump is not Bernard Madoff,\u201d the ruling says. \u201cYet, defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways. Instead, they adopt a \u2018See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\u2019 posture that the evidence belies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, called the verdict a \u201ccomplete and total sham.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were No Victims, No Damages, No Complaints,\u201d he said in a statement that claimed the trial was a political attack by Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe Democrat Club-controlled Judge Engoron has already been reversed four times on this case, a shameful record, and he will be reversed again,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement read. \u201cWe cannot let injustice stand, and will fight Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s weaponized persecution at every step.\u201d\n\nTrump attorney Alina Habba also lashed out against the verdict shortly after it was released, calling it \u201ca manifest injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountless hours of testimony proved that there was no wrongdoing, no crime, and no victim,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cGiven the grave stakes, we trust that the Appellate Division will overturn this egregious verdict and end this relentless persecution against my clients.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the course of a 44-day civil trial, the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James accused Trump of grossly exaggerating his wealth in order to secure favorable business loans by deceiving banks and insurers.\n\nThat includes overvaluing his Mar-a-Lago estate by as much as 2,300%, for example, and falsely claiming his penthouse in Trump Tower was three times larger than it actually was.\n\nJames initially argued that Trump and his affiliated businesses should disgorge $250 million, only to increase the figure to $370 million in a post-trial brief.\n\nThe amount is no arbitrary figure: The attorney general\u2019s office estimates that Trump\u2019s fraud yielded at least $168 million in illegal gains on his loan to purchase 40 Wall Street; $139 million related to the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C.; $60 million from the sale of Ferry Point golf club; and $2.5 million in bonuses paid to accomplices.\n\nEngoron found in an earlier part of the trial that Trump had indeed committed fraud for years. All that remained was to tally up the damages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Engoron concluded in his 35-page September ruling.\n\n\u201cIn defendants\u2019 world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party\u2019s lies,\u201d Engoron wrote. \u201cThat is a fantasy world, not the real world.\u201d\n\nTrump speaks to the media at a Washington hotel in January. His attorney on Friday called the verdict \u201ca manifest injustice.\u201d AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nDefense attorney Chris Kise blamed Trump\u2019s accountants for the fraud, describing the case against his client as \u201cmanufactured to pursue a political agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Trump relied on multimillion-dollar accountants at Mazars,\u201d Kise said in his closing statement. Kise suggested that, instead of punishing Trump, he \u201cshould get a medal\u201d for his business acumen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe accounting firm Mazars cut ties with Trump in 2022, warning at the time that the financial statements it prepared for Trump from 2011 through 2020 \u201cshould no longer be relied upon.\u201d\n\nWhile on the stand as a witness, Trump repeatedly pointed to what he called a \u201cdisclaimer clause\u201d appended to those statements that he believed absolved him of all responsibility for their accuracy.\n\n\u201cWe would call it a worthless statement clause,\u201d he said at one point, seeking to diminish the value of the fraudulent documents. \u201cThey were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to.\u201d\n\nEngoron dismissed the argument in a pretrial ruling.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 reliance on these \u2018worthless\u2019 disclaimers is worthless,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe \u2018worthless clause\u2019 does not say what the defendants say it says, does not rise to the level of an enforceable disclaimer, and cannot be used to insulate fraud.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the months-long trial, Trump complained frequently on social media about the lack of a jury, ignoring the fact that his lawyers hadn\u2019t attempted to request one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe repeatedly described the trial as \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d in addition to attacking Engoron and other court staffers on social media. Trump repeatedly violated a gag order intended to curtail those attacks, then demanded a mistrial, claiming in part that the order violated his First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\nIn additional attempts to dismiss the suit, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued there wasn\u2019t evidence that Trump\u2019s actions had caused public harm and that the statute of limitations had expired for many of the allegations.\n\nTrump declined to testify in his defense, despite having claimed he would, and backed out of delivering his own closing argument after Engoron insisted that Trump address only the \u201crelevant\u201d matters of the case should he do so.",

He sentenced him to prison, he was isolated in prison \u2015 even all that didn\u2019t stop him from calling him out for his lies. Even in prison, he was a powerful voice for the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHis courage will not be forgotten.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVice President Kamala Harris also called out Putin and his regime.\n\n\u201cIf confirmed, this would be a further sign of Putin\u2019s brutality,\u201d she said of Navalny\u2019s death in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, which Navalny\u2019s wife attended. \u201cWhatever story they tell, let us be clear, Russia is responsible.\u201d\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan also reacted with criticism of Putin, citing his government\u2019s history of suppression and brutality.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris on Friday said Navalny's death, if confirmed, would offer \"a further sign\" of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \"brutality.\" picture alliance via Getty Images\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s responsible for this,\u201d Blinken told reporters. \u201cThe fear of one man only underscores the weakness and rot at the heart of the system that Putin has built.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s confirmed, it is a terrible tragedy,\u201d Sullivan separately told NPR. \u201cGiven the Russian government\u2019s long and sordid history of doing harm to its opponents, it raises real and obvious questions about what happened here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEuropean leaders were also quick to blame Putin and describe Navalny as a martyr for democracy.\n\nRussia has \u201csome very serious questions to answer,\u201d NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters. \u201cAlexei Navalny has been a strong voice for freedom, for democracy for many years and NATO and NATO allies have called for his release for a long time.\u201d\n\nProtesters hold posters with a portrait of Navalny and a sign that reads \"Putin is a killer\" during a protest in front of the Russian embassy in Berlin on Friday. via Associated Press\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel also slammed Russia.\n\n\u201cThe [European Union] holds the Russian regime for sole responsible for this tragic death,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAlexei Navalny fought for the values of freedom and democracy. For his ideals, he made the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d\n\nLatvian President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds didn\u2019t mince words while reacting to reports of Navalny\u2019s death, calling it a murder.\n\n\u201cWhatever your thoughts about Alexey Navalny as the politician, he was just brutally murdered by the Kremlin,\u201d he posted on social media. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact and that is something one should know about the true nature of Russia\u2019s current regime.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz similarly hailed Navalny\u2019s selflessness and courage while condemning Russia.\n\nAn image of Navalny is seen alongside floral tributes near the Russian Embassy in London following news that the jailed Russian opposition leader has died. James Manning - PA Images via Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe stood up for democracy and freedom in Russia \u2014 and apparently paid for his courage with his life,\u201d Scholz said in a statement. \u201cThis terrible news shows once again how Russia has changed and what kind of regime is in power in Moscow.\u201d\n\nNavalny\u2019s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, reportedly received a standing ovation while speaking at the Munich Security Conference and urging the international community to stand together against Russia\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cWhatever your thoughts about Alexey Navalny as the politician, he was just brutally murdered by the Kremlin.\u201d - Latvian President Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI would like to call upon all the international community, all the people in the world, we should come together and we should fight against this evil,\u201d Navalnaya said, according to The Washington Post. \u201cWe should fight this horrific regime in Russia today.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Federal Prison Service said Navalny died Friday after losing consciousness at a penal colony while serving out a 19-year sentence on extremism charges. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson criticized Western governments for being so quick to cast blame on the Kremlin before forensic medical data has been made available.\n\nSee more responses below:\n\nIn today's Russia, free spirits are sent to the Gulag and condemned to death.

My thoughts go out to his family, loved ones, and to the Russian people. \u2014 Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) February 16, 2024\n\nAlexey, we will never forget you. And we will never forgive them. \u2014 Donald Tusk (@donaldtusk) February 16, 2024\n\nAlexei @navalny's death is yet another dark reminder of the rogue regime we\u2019re dealing with \u2013 and why Russia and all those responsible must be held accountable for each of their crimes.\n\n\n\nMy condolences. Thinking of all those who still sit behind bars for their political views. \u2014 Kaja Kallas (@kajakallas) February 16, 2024\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReports of Alexei Navalny\u2019s death are tragic and horrifying.

Let this be an important reminder that we must continue to\u2026 \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) February 16, 2024\n\nThis is terrible news.

    "text": "Former President Donald Trump speaks to the press in New York City on Feb. 15, 2024. ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has discussed supporting a national 16-week abortion ban, according to a Friday report from The New York Times.\n\nTrump reportedly said that if he were to win the 2024 presidential election, he would support a 16-week abortion ban nationwide with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant person, according to two people close to Trump who spoke with the Times. The idea of a 16-week ban falls out of line with abortion restrictions that other conservatives have pushed at the state level, including six-week and 15-week abortion bans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former president reportedly said in a private conversation shared with the Times that he likes the idea of a 16-week federal ban because it\u2019s an \u201ceven\u201d four months. He also reportedly said that he will not consider any vice presidential candidate who does not support exceptions for rape, incest or life of the mother.\n\nThe Trump campaign denied the Times\u2019 report, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d in a press release.\n\n\u201cAs President Trump has stated, he would sit down with both sides and negotiate a deal that everyone will be happy with,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a press secretary for the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump appointed strong Constitutionalist federal judges and Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade and sent the decision back to the states, which others have tried to do for over 50 years,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cJoe Biden and virtually every Democrat in Congress is on the record supporting radical on-demand abortion up until the moment of birth, and after birth, as well as using American tax dollars to fund the killing of the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nOne of the largest and most extreme anti-abortion groups in the country praised Trump in a Friday statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe strongly agree with President Trump on protecting babies from abortion violence at 16 weeks when they feel pain,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\nTrump has previously shied away from discussing abortion, likely in an attempt to appeal to a wider group of voters. Big Republican losses in the past two years have signaled that extreme anti-abortion policies are not popular on a national level. Trump himself has even attributed his party\u2019s setbacks in the 2022 midterms to candidates\u2019 extreme stances on abortion.\n\n\u201cToday, Roe v. Wade is no longer the law of the land. And that\u2019s because of one person: Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said in a press statement.\n\n\u201cNow, after being the one responsible for taking away women\u2019s freedom, after being the one to put women\u2019s lives in danger, after being the one who has unleashed all this cruelty and chaos all across America, Trump is running scared,\u201d the president\u2019s statement continued. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid the women of America are going to hold him responsible for taking away their rights and endangering their rights at the ballot box in November. Which is exactly what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s reelection campaign held a press call Friday afternoon to discuss the news around Trump. Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodriguez, Biden\u2019s campaign manager, along with Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, and Jessica Mackler, the interim president of EMILY\u2019s List, joined the call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe fundamental choice in this election is going to be between Joe Biden and [Vice President] Kamala Harris, who are running to restore Roe as the law of the land against Donald Trump, who\u2019s out here every single day bragging about the role that he personally played in overturning Roe,\u201d Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director, said during the press call.\n\n\u201cHe is now planning to ban abortion across the country. As the president said, he doesn\u2019t have a clue about the power of American women, and he\u2019s about to find out in November.\u201d\n\nNearly 75% of voters in a 2023 Change Research survey said that recent abortion restrictions have gone too far, including 51% of those who voted for Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long known where Donald Trump stands on abortion and it\u2019s at odds with the majority of Americans,\u201d Jenny Lawson, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHe is chiefly responsible for the ongoing public health crisis that has allowed 21 states to ban all or some abortions and yet, he claims to want to find a \u2018compromise\u2019 on this issue. To be clear, there is no compromising on the basic right to control our lives and bodies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Martinns via Getty Images If you're fever-free without medication for at least 24 hours, the potential new CDC COVID-19 isolation guidelines say you can return to work.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering changing its COVID-19 isolation guidance, marking a shift from how we currently attempt to prevent the spread of the illness.\n\nThe current rules instruct folks to isolate for at least five days once they test positive, but The Washington Post reported that the new guidelines would instead depend on symptoms. If you\u2019re fever-free without medication for 24 hours and have mild or improving symptoms, you can end isolation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny changes to guidelines would not happen until at least April, according to NPR.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like they\u2019re not considering doing this until after we\u2019re done with this respiratory viral season, which certainly makes sense,\u201d said Dr. Kristin Englund, a staff member of the department of infectious disease at Cleveland Clinic. \u201cWe still have a lot of different viruses, whether it be influenza, some RSV, or there\u2019s certainly still an amount of COVID that\u2019s circulating in all of the communities right now.\u201d\n\nRegardless, this would be a big transition from the current protocols. While some would argue that it\u2019s dangerous, others also point out that not everyone can afford isolation. Here\u2019s what infectious disease experts think of the potential change:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese proposed guidelines rely on personal responsibility and prior immunity.\n\n\u201cIn general ... we shouldn\u2019t go to work when we\u2019re sick, and so what this proposed change would do \u2015 in my view \u2015 is normalize COVID, along with other respiratory viral infections like influenza or RSV, or the many other viruses that can cause respiratory illness,\u201d said Dr. Mark J. Mulligan, the director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center.\n\nMulligan stressed that it\u2019s our personal responsibility to be honest about our symptoms and to not go out in public if we\u2019re sick. Even once you\u2019ve improved, you should still take precautions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnce we\u2019ve not had fever for a day or so and if our symptoms are improving and mostly mild, it\u2019s reasonable to go back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even then, it\u2019s possible that this guideline will suggest that people should wear a mask when they do return to work ... I don\u2019t know what [the] guideline will say, but that\u2019s another possibility.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, this proposed change takes into account the immunity many people have from vaccination, previous COVID infection or both, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are likely to be protected against severe disease, hospitalization and death \u2014 when the pandemic started in the early phases, when most of us did not have any immune protection, that was not the case,\u201d Mulligan said. \u201cWe built up a level of community immunity where I think something like this is reasonable to be discussing.\u201d\n\nThe change addresses the fact that many people can\u2019t always stay home from work for five days.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a difficult decision, I understand. We have changed a lot since 2021 in how we approach this virus,\u201d Englund said. \u201cWe do now have effective vaccines against it \u2014 not that we use vaccines to replace masking and isolation \u2014 but it certainly helps to control the amount of virus that\u2019s in our communities to the point now where we can consider a little bit more freedom from the previous isolation policy.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, with more and more people relying on at-home testing as opposed to testing at a doctor\u2019s office, it makes it harder for people to isolate, Englund said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWorkplaces may not be as willing to accept an at-home test as they would from, say, getting it from a hospital and getting a physician\u2019s note. So, it\u2019s difficult for people to actually conform to that at-home isolation policy nowadays,\u201d she said.\n\nThis possible new guidance could discount severe outcomes or those who are high-risk.\n\nIn response to the potential guideline change, Dr. Richard A. Martinello, a Yale Medicine infectious diseases physician, said he\u2019s \u201ca bit torn.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we have seen both less COVID circulating this year and a lower severity of disease, COVID remains [the cause of] significant illness, with some persons experiencing complications such as severe disease requiring hospitalization or long COVID,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough many recover just fine from COVID, that is not the case for everyone. Mulligan said that \u201cpeople with weak immune systems may not have immunity like most of us; that is, even if they got the vaccine, even if they\u2019ve had past COVID, they may not have mounted a protective immune response.\u201d\n\n\u201cTherefore, this is a significant group in society that will be put at increased risk, potentially, if the proposed change is instituted,\u201d Mulligan added, which makes it crucial that folks understand their personal responsibility when it comes to virus spread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople need to know that there is still risk and that there are additional actions which can be taken to reduce this risk,\u201d Martinello said. \u201cThese actions include staying home when sick, masking, vaccination, testing and optimizing indoor air quality.\u201d\n\nEnglund noted that those who are high-risk should stay up-to-date on all vaccines, including COVID, flu and RSV shots. Loved ones need to do the same so viruses won\u2019t be passed on. In indoor spaces where you can\u2019t maintain social distancing, wear a mask and use hand sanitizer, she added.\n\nRealPeopleGroup via Getty Images Masking will be even more important if the proposed change does go through.\n\nMasking should become the norm again.\n\n\u201cMy hope is certainly that based upon what we\u2019ve been through, masking becomes more of a norm,\u201d Englund said. \u201cI know a lot of people have stopped wearing masks, but I think we see other countries where masking is very commonplace for them and I think it needs to be something that is not stigmatized here in the U.S.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel well and need to go out, wear a mask so you don\u2019t spread whatever virus to your community, coworkers or loved ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt simply shows that you\u2019re caring for somebody else\u2019s health and safety ... this just needs to be something that we accept in this society,\u201d Englund said.\n\nJust because the guidelines might become less strict doesn\u2019t mean COVID is gone.\n\n\u201cI certainly think that COVID is here to stay ... I think the country and the world needs to understand that just because it\u2019s not on the news all the time, COVID can be deadly,\u201d Englund said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to stay aware and do all that you can to protect yourself and your community, which means getting vaccinated, wearing a mask if you feel ill and staying away from those who are immunocompromised.\n\nEnglund also said that although lockdown isolation is gone, we need to \u201cbe able to rely on people to do the right thing and stay home\u201d when we\u2019re not feeling well.\n\nAll in all, the guidelines address the changing views of COVID.\n\n\u201cWe still need to see the final recommendation from the CDC, but this is yet another sign that we are transitioning from the pandemic to a new period where COVID is considered an endemic disease,\u201d Martinello said. \u201cBeing an endemic disease in no way means that it is insignificant.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an example, Martinello highlighted how influenza is endemic and has a significant impact on the health of people living in the U.S., with tens of thousands of Americans dying of the flu each year.\n\n\u201cI think the pandemic has taught us that we were perhaps too accepting of viral respiratory infections in the past and that there are actions we can take to decrease the risk [of] us [getting] sick,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile views on COVID are shifting, it\u2019s important to remember that a segment of society is still at higher risk. Just because the guidance changes doesn\u2019t mean members of your community are not at risk.\n\n\u201cLooking back to our pre-pandemic time, we were too accepting of the risk for illness. We can stay healthier by getting vaccinated, using masks and improving indoor air quality,\u201d Martinello said.\n\nSupport HuffPost A Healthier, Happier 2024 At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

    "text": "JulPo via Getty Images A viral TikTok has people asking if tipping culture has gotten out of control.\n\nTipping the person who cuts your hair may seem obvious enough, but a response to a viral video this week suggests that there\u2019s still confusion about gratuity on beauty services.\n\nOn Sunday, Justice, a TikToker who uses the handle @antidietpilot, posted about how she decided not to tip on the $350 hair braids she recently got. The braids \u2015 small, knotless braids with a French curl on the end \u2015 took more than 7 hours to complete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Justice was happy with the results \u2015 she called the stylist \u201cthe best braider\u201d she\u2019d ever had \u2015 she had her reasons for forgoing a tip.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t have to commute [and] she\u2019s not paying any overhead because she works from home,\u201d Justice explained in the video, which now has over 5.1 million views. \u201cI think that\u2019s a really good price. How many people are making [roughly] $40 an hour?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustice said she was a little nervous about how her stylist would react to her not tipping, but ultimately, she\u2019s unapologetic about her decision.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say tipping is how you say thank you but to me, saying thank you is how you say thank you,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRespecting peoples\u2019 policies, arriving to your appointment on time\u2026 letting them take photos of their work after and telling your friends or social media followers [about them] is how you say thank you,\u201d she added.\n\nNot everyone agreed. Some who were in favor of tipping pointed to how long the session took.\n\n\u201cNot tipping on your fast food or Starbucks is fine but 7.5 HOURS? I would never not tip,\u201d one woman said.\n\nMost commenters seemed to agree with Justice, though. With inflation already driving up prices, many said they increasingly feel that tipping culture has gotten out of control.\n\n\u201cThe entire cost is going to her. Tipping isn\u2019t required,\u201d one person wrote.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely right,\u201d another woman said. \u201cPeople who braid [or] do makeup definitely charge their worth. Tipping culture in the U.S. is crazy sometimes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor better or worse, tipping remains the wild west: More than 70% of Americans believe the expectation to tip has increased in the last five years, according to a 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center, but few know what to do when a tablet with a tipping options is handed to them. Only about a third said it\u2019s \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery easy\u201d to know if tipping is necessary and if so, how much to include.\n\nHairstylists have varying opinions\n\nThe whole conversation on \u201ctipflation\u201d and what\u2019s a fair gratuity left out an important voice: The hairstylists themselves. How do they feel about tip-fatigued customers like the woman on TikTok?\n\n\u201cAs far as the video goes, I don\u2019t blame her,\u201d said Collin Martin, a hair stylist in Englewood, Florida, and a hair industry educator.\n\nHe said he obviously appreciates clients who tip, but he doesn\u2019t expect it either. He\u2019d be screwed if he did, he said.\n\n\u201cTo base even a portion of my income on the emotional response of another human being is\u2026 do I even have to finish the sentence?\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI have learned to never bank on it and I have been a much happier hairdresser ever since.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of relying on tips, Martin said he prefers to \u201cjust charge my worth.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnowing your value is the most important part of being a hairdresser,\u201d he added.\n\nJavi Sanz via Getty Images Given the rising costs of products and running a business, many stylists are opting to include a tip in their overall pricing structure.\n\nJohn Mosley, a barber and men\u2019s grooming expert in Dallas, Texas, agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything wrong if a client decides not to tip,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, Mosley\u2019s client list includes Kendrick Lamar and Eminem, but when he began working as a barber, Mosley clients weren\u2019t always so monied. Even so, most tipped.\n\n\u201cIn your local barber shop, clients kind of feel like they are supporting the business, and helping [the business] make up for what they might lose in lower prices,\u201d Mosley said.\n\nJ. Clark Walker, a barber and owner at Major Studios in Salt Lake City, Utah, thought the TikToker had some valid points. Still, he had a hunch that her stylist was pretty surprised that there was no tip after seven hours on her feet. \u201cFor a top-notch service, if you can afford it, I think you should always leave a little tip,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s had great clients that don\u2019t tip, some that never have, and a whole bunch that just forget. \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously very noticeable when a client tips well,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember great tippers, for sure.\u201d\n\nTamara Necole is a stylist who specializes in wig making and weave installations. At the high-end full-service hair salon she works at in Culver City, California, her various services run from $175 to $850.\n\nThere are no hard feelings when someone doesn\u2019t tip but she admits she does often wonder if they\u2019re not 100% happy with her service: \u201cIf they return, I use that as an opportunity to provide them with a better experience,\u201d she told HuffPost.\n\nJupiterimages via Getty Images Instead of relying on tips, some hairstylists say they \u201cjust charge [their] worth.\u201d\n\nNot everyone was so forgiving of the TikToker and her non-tipping ways.\n\n\u201cI think the woman in the video is the worst type of client,\u201d said Hamuidah Anderson, a San Diego, California-based stylist who specializes in extensions and whose services run from $85 to $675.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t respect people in the beauty industry, but I bet she would at a restaurant when the bill is $400,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cSeven hours is a long time to work on someone\u2019s hair.\u201d\n\nAnderson told HuffPost she probably wouldn\u2019t see the client after that. \u201cI would block her. Or refer her to an amateur.\u201d\n\nIf the gratuity is included on the bill, do you still tip?\n\nGiven the rising prices of products and running a business (namely, rent and other overhead costs), many stylists now include a tip to their service charge.\n\nThat may take some of the awkwardness out of the situation for those who worry about the \u201cright\u201d amount to give, but it could rub others the wrong way, said Nycole Jones, a hair stylist and the owner of Yara Luxe Hair Perfume, a high-end salon in Miami, Florida.\n\n\u201cSome clients may appreciate the convenience of not having to calculate a separate tip, while others may prefer the flexibility of determining their tip based on the quality of service received,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOK, but what if the hair stylist owns the business?\n\nSome wonder: Does the amount you tip \u2015 or even the need to tip \u2015 depend on if the stylist is self-employed and taking all their pay home versus working at a salon that takes a cut?\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think that should factor in,\u201d Jones said. \u201cTipping is a gesture of appreciation for the service provided, regardless of the stylist\u2019s employment status.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the amount one chooses to tip should reflect their satisfaction with the service received and the expertise demonstrated by the stylist, she said\n\nWalker, the barber in Salt Lake City, doesn\u2019t think ownership should matter, either.\n\n\u201cDo people look into whether the bartender owns the bar before they decide to tip?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen in doubt, I\u2019d say to give 20% if you can afford it.\u201d\n\nSupport HuffPost A Healthier, Happier 2024 At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

    "text": "Joe Biden and Kamala Harris celebrated what would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade in late January \u2014 their first campaign event of 2024. The \u201cRestore Roe\u201d rally in northern Virginia made it clear that the Biden/Harris ticket will center abortion rights in the reelection campaign. The theater was filled with the president\u2019s supporters and leadership from national reproductive rights organizations who have endorsed him, including Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for Women and Reproductive Freedom for All.\n\nOnly a few minutes into Biden\u2019s speech, several protesters interrupted, calling for a cease-fire in Israel\u2019s U.S.-backed military operation in Gaza, which has killed more than 28,000 Palestinians and set off a maternal and reproductive health crisis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president was interrupted over a dozen times as security struggled to wrangle protesters who were screaming \u201cGenocide Joe!\u201d and demanding a cease-fire. Hundreds of Biden supporters tried to drown out the protesters by clapping and chanting, \u201cFour more years!\u201d\n\n\u201cIsrael kills two mothers every hour in Gaza! Cease-fire now! End the genocide!\u201d one protester yelled at Biden, who was standing on stage in front of a massive \u201cRestore Roe\u201d banner and flanked by supporters holding \u201cDefend choice\u201d signs.\n\nA video of the event shows Alexis McGill Johnson, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, clad in her trademark hot-pink pantsuit, standing up and chanting \u201cFour more years!\u201d as security dragged the shouting protester out.\n\nIt was a real-time illustration of the growing rift in the reproductive rights movement during an election year that will determine the future of reproductive health in the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018No One Is Making The Connection\u2019\n\nBiden has seemingly embraced abortion rights, a pivotal issue for Democrats, and earned an extremely early endorsement from national reproductive rights groups. Despite the president making abortion rights a pillar of his campaign, Biden is generally reluctant to talk about abortion, saying things like \u201cI\u2019m not big on abortion\u201d and, more recently, \u201cI don\u2019t want abortion on demand.\u201d When it comes to abortion care, many who work for reproductive justice believe that the president is a lukewarm advocate at best.\n\nNow workers are deeply concerned that Biden\u2019s administration is contributing to a maternal and reproductive health crisis in Gaza through its aid to Israel.\n\nGaza is home to about 55,000 women who are currently pregnant, according to a recent report. There\u2019s been a 300% increase in pregnancy loss due to the lack of neonatal and maternal health care since the conflict began five months ago. Most women are giving birth in crowded tents or on the streets because there\u2019s no ambulance or car to take them to a hospital. There have been several reports of women undergoing C-sections without anesthesia or properly sanitized medical tools, leading to wound infections.\n\nBasic prenatal care, such as treating anemia, is nonexistent, causing more women to die during childbirth and more babies born prematurely, many of whom die without access to hospital incubators. Food shortages are leaving pregnant women, new mothers and newborns malnourished. And a lack of menstrual hygiene products has caused an increase in infections in women and girls.\n\n\u201cNo one is making the connection that there\u2019s a huge repro genocide happening in Gaza that we are funding, and the big repro organizations that are endorsing him are pretending like it\u2019s not happening,\u201d one leader who has met with the Biden administration on abortion issues told HuffPost. Most of the workers who spoke with HuffPost asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from their employers or others in the reproductive rights field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo one is making the connection that there\u2019s a huge repro genocide happening in Gaza that we are funding.\u201d\n\nHuffPost spoke with over a dozen people who work for reproductive justice causes \u2015 including current Planned Parenthood employees, legal experts, nurse midwives, abortion fund workers and clinic staffers from across the country \u2015 who say that Biden\u2019s unwavering support for Israel has fractured the movement. The rift has left those who support Palestinians to feel ostracized by the larger reproductive rights groups and questioning whether they can vote for Biden in November. They also fear retaliation.\n\nAll of the workers said that they cannot ignore how their reproductive justice work in the U.S. ties into the reproductive health crisis happening in Gaza, especially when the U.S. is actively involved in the conflict.\n\nMany of the workers stressed that although abortion access is critically important, it\u2019s part of the larger reproductive justice framework that includes the right to choose when and how to have a child and the right to raise that child in a safe environment.\n\n\u201cDenying a woman dignified health care in birth is such a huge part of reproductive justice. How can you not see that this is the same thing?\u201d Allie Felker, a stillbirth prevention advocate whose first child was stillborn, told HuffPost. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to reproductive justice than just having access to abortions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe workers tell HuffPost they cannot in good conscience vote for Biden in the 2024 election given his ardent support for Israel. Nearly every worker, including those at Planned Parenthood, said they wished big reproductive rights organizations, which have the ability to endorse and help fund presidential candidates, had used their political power to demand a Democratic candidate that was a stronger advocate for abortion rights.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much you can do in 10 months to make Biden a better candidate, and instead of doing that, you\u2019re yelling at people like me who have been doing the hard work for a long time,\u201d one abortion fund worker from the South told HuffPost. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I should forget about all these bad things he\u2019s done because it could be worse, instead of asking the person who could change things to change them.\u201d\n\nA protester shouts in support of the people of Gaza as President Joe Biden speaks at a \"Restore Roe\" campaign rally on Jan. 23 in Manassas, Virginia. SAUL LOEB via Getty Images\n\nBiden\u2019s halfhearted support for abortion access had already soured many of the workers on his administration. Many said they can no longer support a candidate who barely says the word \u201cabortion\u201d and is working to restore a status quo that never gave marginalized people abortion access to begin with. Some said that Biden\u2019s policy stance on immigration also contributed to their decision to not vote for him in November. Everyone said that Gaza was the last straw.\n\nThey understand what\u2019s at stake: A second Trump presidency would likely be worse for abortion access in the U.S. But they\u2019re tired of campaigning for Democrats who rarely listen to frontline service workers and then renege on their abortion rights promises once in office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Biden campaign declined to comment on the record.\n\n\u201cThe Biden administration is using abortion access to win his presidential campaign, which is a huge problem when there is a reproductive justice crisis in Palestine that he is contributing to,\u201d said one Planned Parenthood employee.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge divide in our movement now that a lot of the union workers are talking about. We\u2019re feeling used; we\u2019re feeling abandoned,\u201d the worker added. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a betrayal to see these CEOs saying \u2018Four more years\u2019 when Biden hasn\u2019t even done anything to help our movement.\u201d\n\nTwo people in the reproductive rights space who are close to some of the national groups told HuffPost that organizations don\u2019t penalize employees for speaking out about their viewpoints. Leaders at these groups are also put in a tough position, they said, because they\u2019re asked to put their personal opinions aside in order to lead in an environment that can be hostile.\n\n\u201cDenying a woman dignified health care in birth is such a huge part of reproductive justice. How can you not see that this is the same thing?\u201d\n\nVoters need to pay more attention to Vice President Kamala Harris, they said, who they believe has been a critical part of the administration\u2019s push to protect abortion care. \u201cVice President Harris\u2019 words and actions have made her, in particular, the reproductive rights champion that we need for the time that we\u2019re in,\u201d one of the people who works closely with some of the national organizations told HuffPost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to work with [the administration], but we also push them,\u201d they said. \u201cJust because people don\u2019t hear it or see it doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t using the relationship that we have to push them harder.\u201d\n\nTensions Rise Across The Movement\n\nMany of the U.S. workers became emotional when discussing what they described as genocide in the Gaza Strip. They told HuffPost they can\u2019t ignore the racist history of the reproductive rights movement.\n\n\u201cThe truth is it plays right into our movement\u2019s history of participating in reproductive coercion, injustice and genocide,\u201d the reproductive rights leader who has met with the Biden administration told HuffPost, referring to the sterilization of Puerto Rican women who sought contraception and the experimentation on Black women\u2019s bodies to create modern gynecological care. \u201cWhat I see is our movement\u2019s history repeating itself, and that is so dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about the entire generations of Palestinians who are dead so, what, this man can stay in office?\u201d\n\nARC Southeast, an abortion fund in the South, is one of the few reproductive rights organizations in the U.S. that has put out a powerful, in-depth statement of support for the Palestinian people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuch of the statement acknowledges the parallels between the barriers their callers, the majority of whom are Black, experience when trying to get health care in the South and the obstacles to maternal and reproductive health care Palestinians are facing. Nearly 70 other grassroots reproductive justice organizations across the country signed on in support of the statement, which was published in October.\n\nRepro Jobs, a hub for workers in the industry, also published a statement signed by about 700 workers that calls for a cease-fire and acknowledges the industrywide concern over the \u201crising suppression of speech\u201d of workers who protest the \u201cgenocide of Palestinians.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Planned Parenthood put out a statement in December that directly condemned Hamas for killing Israelis but chose to use a passive voice when describing Palestinian deaths. Many employees were deeply frustrated with the statement because, they said, it did little to acknowledge the violence in Gaza and did not call for a cease-fire.\n\nMore than 430 current and former employees, as well as donors, criticized Planned Parenthood in a letter responding to the organization\u2019s statement. The letter was written by PPFA union workers who claimed that their employer\u2019s December statement contributed to the spread of \u201crampant disinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor PPFA to ignore the Israeli government\u2019s war crimes against the Palestinian people stands antithetical to their purported mission to fight for the dignity, safety, and rights of all people,\u201d the letter says. The letter is endorsed by a range of departments that the signatories work in, including Planned Parenthood\u2019s litigation and law sector, Planned Parenthood Global and Planned Parenthood state groups from all over the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlanned Parenthood declined to comment on the record.\n\nSome workers who spoke with HuffPost acknowledged that this is simply the role of larger organizations during a critical election year; organizations like Planned Parenthood have to tread carefully on controversial issues in order to ensure donations continue, some said. Others felt differently.\n\n\u201cAll of the Planned Parenthood workers, I think we know that Planned Parenthood is a white liberal feminist organization that\u2019s of the Hillary Clinton types or imperial feminists,\u201d one Planned Parenthood worker said. \u201cThrough our unions we\u2019re trying to change that\u2026 but it\u2019s not easy.\u201d\n\nReproductive Justice Isn\u2019t Only About Abortion Care\n\nSince October, the Biden administration has supported Israel on the world stage, bypassing Congress multiple times to approve sending weapons to Israel.\n\nDespite months of international criticism and growing concern from lawmakers at home, Biden has aided Israel like no other president before him. He only recently began pushing for a \u201csustained pause\u201d in fighting and calling Israel\u2019s military response in Gaza \u201cover the top.\u201d The president promised to adjust U.S. policy to curb violence in the region, though current and former officials told HuffPost\u2019s Akbar Shahid Ahmed that they\u2019re skeptical the administration will actually reduce U.S. military or diplomatic support for Israel.\n\n24 year-old Rua al-Sindavi, a Palestinian woman pregnant with triplets, expects to give birth in a tent due to insufficient medical facilities. She recently had to migrate to Rafah due to Israeli attacks on February 14, 2024. Sindavi suffers from malnutrition and extreme anaemia due to the food shortages in the city. Abed Zagout/Anadolu via Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Deborah Harrington, a high-risk obstetrician, saw women die from pregnancy complications in December when she worked in Al-Aqsa Hospital in central Gaza for two weeks as part of a humanitarian aid trip.\n\nHarrington told HuffPost that most of the maternal and newborn health care providers were moved to Al-Helal Al-Emirati Maternity Hospital in Rafah, one of the last designated \u201csafe zones,\u201d sheltering nearly 1.4 million displaced Gazans.\n\nAl-Emirati hospital was designed to accommodate 30 to 40 daily appointments for pregnant patients but now sees 300 to 400 pregnant women, postpartum mothers and newborns each day. Most of the newborns admitted to Al-Emirati are dying of infections because of the horrible conditions, said Dr. Ahmed Al Shaer, a pediatric specialist at the hospital.\n\n\u201cToday I am scheduled for a cesarean section, then I\u2019ll return to the same suffering in the tent,\u201d a pregnant woman at Al-Emirati told the United Nations. \u201cI will be facing difficulties after birth from physical pain to an ice-cold tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe baby has no clothes,\u201d she added before starting to cry.\n\nIsrael began airstrikes in Rafah this week. One Gazan described the first night as full of \u201chorror, strikes, death and destruction.\u201d Harrington fears for her colleagues who are continuing their work at Al-Emirati hospital, adding that there will likely be no place left to safely give birth if Rafah becomes an active military zone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFelker, the stillbirth prevention advocate, was part of a group of reproductive justice workers who disrupted a Harris campaign event that was part of the vice president\u2019s \u201cFight for Reproductive Freedoms\u201d tour late last month in San Jose, California.\n\nBefore Felker stood from her seat to demand a cease-fire, she said there were several women sitting on either side of her who were cheering any time Harris talked about reproductive freedom. When Felker stood up and yelled: \u201cCease-fire now! I have lost a child, I know how these women [in Gaza] feel,\u201d the same women pulled on her purse to get her to sit down. One woman stood in front of her and said, \u201cI will not let you speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we first attained these [reproductive] rights, it was from women doing exactly what I\u2019m doing: standing up for justice, protesting, shouting in the streets, raising our voices,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s like these same women who would champion that justice here are standing against me for championing that justice where our administration is actively repressing it.\u201d\n\nSupport HuffPost Our 2024 Coverage Needs You At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nPresident Joe Biden visited the disaster-stricken rural village of East Palestine, Ohio, on Friday, more than a year after a freight train loaded with hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic chemicals derailed there.\n\nBiden faced enormous criticism for not making the trip sooner, with some Republicans accusing him of ignoring the community because of its history of voting Republican. East Palestine residents and independent scientists have also criticized federal and state agencies for their missteps in responding to the disaster; many people remain fearful about what the chemical exposure could mean for their long-term health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden called the response and recovery efforts in East Palestine over the last year \u201cHerculean\u201d and vowed to hold rail giant Norfolk Southern fully accountable for the disaster.\n\n\u201cWhile there are acts of God, this was an act of greed that was 100% preventable,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNorfolk Southern failed its responsibility.\u201d\n\nBiden touted his administration\u2019s efforts to date, including monitoring air, water and soil, but stressed there is more work to be done.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going home, no matter what, until this job is done,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to do. The vast majority has been done, but we\u2019re going to stay until the very end, [until] every need is met.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJami Wallace, a lifelong resident of East Palestine and president of the Unity Council for the East Palestine Train Derailment, told HuffPost ahead of Biden\u2019s visit that the president should have traveled to the community a year ago.\n\n\u201cThe time was then \u2014 not even just as a president, but as a parent of a child who was subjected to chemicals and lost his life,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWhere was his empathy for all the citizens in this area that are facing those same unanswered questions about their children when it comes to exposure to multiple chemicals? He\u2019s seen the worst outcome firsthand. So why wasn\u2019t he here just to support the community? The fact that he waited so long shows me that he doesn\u2019t really care.\u201d\n\nWallace was referring to Biden\u2019s son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015. Biden has speculated that his son\u2019s cancer was caused by exposure to toxic chemicals from burn pits during his military service in Iraq.\n\nThe train, operated by Norfolk Southern, derailed Feb. 3, 2023, while hauling numerous hazardous and flammable materials, including hundreds of thousands of pounds of vinyl chloride, a cancer-causing chemical used in the production of plastics. The EPA has repeatedly stressed that the air, water and soil in East Palestine are safe, a conclusion that is based on testing of individual chemicals that have largely been detected at levels below minimal risk thresholds.\n\nBut the situation in the community is far more complicated than any single toxin. Residents were exposed to potentially dozens of chemicals simultaneously after the railroad and local officials intentionally set fire to tankers cars full of vinyl chloride. The so-called \u201ccontrolled burn\u201d was aimed at preventing a potentially catastrophic explosion, but released thick plumes of toxic smoke into East Palestine and neighboring communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA black plume rises over East Palestine, Ohio, as a result of a controlled detonation of a portion of the derailed Norfolk Southern trains on Feb. 6, 2023. via Associated Press\n\nThe truth \u2014 one that EPA has largely avoided talking about \u2014 is that authorities have little, if any, understanding about how low-level chemical mixtures could be wreaking havoc on human health, as HuffPost previously reported. The agency\u2019s safety declaration also fails to acknowledge the numerous health issues that residents and first responders reported in the wake of the disaster, including nosebleeds, headaches and respiratory problems.\n\n\u201cI would rather have the EPA say, \u2018You know what \u2014 you guys are sick and we don\u2019t know why,\u2019\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year of the EPA saying we\u2019re fine and our bodies knowing different.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want the truth, even if it is a hard truth,\u201d she added.\n\nAhead of Biden\u2019s visit, the White House sought to allay community concerns and stymie any suggestion that the administration\u2019s response in East Palestine has been political.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said Thursday during a briefing that Biden \u201chas no concerns with drinking the water in East Palestine,\u201d noting that the EPA is \u201cconfident\u201d it is safe for consumption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou will see a president that goes out there \u2014 whether it\u2019s a red state, blue state, urban America, rural America \u2014 to hear and make sure that he is a president for all,\u201d Jean-Pierre added.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks Friday after receiving an operational briefing on the continuing response and recovery efforts at the site of a train derailment that spilled hazardous chemicals a year ago in East Palestine, Ohio. With Biden are Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan (left) and East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick. MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn anticipation of Biden\u2019s trip, community members, independent scientists and Ohio lawmakers called on the Biden administration to take additional steps to help East Palestine.\n\nMore than 200 residents of East Palestine and environmental advocates sent a letter to Biden and EPA Administrator Michael Regan on Thursday, requesting a major disaster declaration as well as additional resources for long-term chemical monitoring, health care and relocation costs. They also called for a ban on vinyl chloride.\n\n\u201cAs you prepare to visit East Palestine this week, now is the time for you to adopt and aggressively put these common-sense recommendations into practice,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) requested Biden issue a disaster declaration in July, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency has yet to approve it.\n\nIn a separate letter to several Cabinet secretaries this week, Ohio Sens. Sherrod Brown (D) and JD Vance (R) urged the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to establish a disease registry to monitor long-term health impacts.\n\n\u201cThe residents of East Palestine deserve to know this disaster has impacted their long-term health,\u201d they wrote.\n\nFor Wallace, Biden\u2019s visit will only be worthwhile if it is accompanied with more aggressive action.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we need from him now is that disaster declaration, so that it opens the doors to get the help that we deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not coming here to take action, then this visit is pointless.\u201d\n\nBiden did not issue a disaster declaration Friday. He did announce that the National Institutes of Health will award six grants to research universities to study the short- and long-term effects of the disaster. And he emphasized his support for that last year\u2019s bipartisan rail safety legislation, which aimed to prevent similar derailments but remains stalled.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll told, we\u2019ve done in one year what would typically take many years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to keep going.\u201d",

    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 Two juveniles were charged with crimes connected to the mass shooting at the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl rally, authorities said Friday, as the city tries to recover in the aftermath of the violence.\n\nA news release from the Jackson County Family Court said the juveniles were charged Thursday and are being detained in the county\u2019s Juvenile Detention Center \u201con gun-related and resisting arrest charges.\u201d The release said it is \u201canticipated that additional charges are expected in the future as the investigation by the Kansas City Police Department continues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo further information was released. Juvenile court cases are largely kept private under Missouri law, and hearings are not open to the public.\n\nPolice initially detained three juveniles but released one who they determined wasn\u2019t involved in the shooting. Police are looking for others who may have been involved and are calling for witnesses, victims and people with cellphone video of the violence to call a dedicated hotline.\n\nMeanwhile, Kansas Citians are turning to religious gathers, vigils and counseling to try to cope with the horror of what happened.\n\nA mother and popular disc jockey died in the burst of gunfire Wednesday as the parade and rally were concluding, and 22 others \u2014 more than half of them children \u2014 were injured. By Friday, two people remained in critical condition and one was in serious condition. Most of the injured children were out of the hospital and expected to recover.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the emotional recovery is only just beginning in a community horrified that two juveniles could cause such trauma. Police believe a dispute between several people led to the shooting.\n\nThe slain woman was identified by radio station KKFI-FM as Lisa Lopez-Galvan, host of \u201cTaste of Tejano.\u201d At a vigil honoring her Thursday night, Councilwoman Ryana Parks-Shaw said the city is working to offer support to those who are struggling.\n\n\u201cRemember that we are not defined by this tragedy,\u201d Parks-Shaw said, the Kansas City Star reported. \u201cWe are defined by our courage, our strength and our unwavering spirits. Hold on to hope. Lean on one another. And know that a brighter tomorrow awaits.\u201d\n\nThe Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office set up in-person counseling for the traumatized. Twelve people attended Thursday, including two children, spokesman Michael Mansur said Friday. The agency also established a hotline offering counseling, but Mansur didn\u2019t immediately have information on how many called the hotline.\n\nThe Chiefs won their third Super Bowl in five years Sunday, beating the San Francisco 49ers 25-22 in overtime. The two previous celebrations went off without any trouble.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, players rode double-decker red buses through Missouri\u2019s largest city. The parade ended with a rally at the sprawling Union Station. It was just breaking up with shots erupted. Many people thought they were hearing fireworks. Eventually, some ducked for cover. Others leapt over barriers and sprinted, many carrying children.\n\nBeyond the gunshot wounds, several people were treated at hospitals for injuries suffered amid the chaos. So many personal belongings were left behind that police set up a site for people to try and find what they lost.\n\nTwo men at the rally jumped on and detained someone with a gun, though police have not confirmed whether it was one of the people arrested.\n\nPaul Contreras of Bellevue, Nebraska, said he heard a man yelling to stop someone and was able to tackle the person from behind. Contreras noticed that the person he tackled had a gun, he said, and he wasn\u2019t sure if he might have another under a heavy jacket.\n\nSoon, Contreras was joined by another man.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like, we got to keep him down until law enforcement gets there. Because as much as we\u2019re fighting to keep him down, he\u2019s fighting to get up,\u201d Contreras, whose daughter captured it all on video, told The Associated Press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe man who helped Contreras was Trey Filter. He was with his family when he heard yells of \u201cget him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe was like, \u2018We got him,\u2019\u201d Filter, 40, of the Wichita, Kansas, area, told AP. \u201cI\u2019ll always remember that. And then they started screaming, \u2018There\u2019s a gun!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe gun fell near his wife, Casey Filter, who picked it up. By then, the fleeing person was under a dogpile.\n\nThe shooting occurred despite the presence of more than 800 police officers in the area, including on top of nearby structures, said Mayor Quinton Lucas, who attended with his wife and mother and ran for safety when the shots were fired. But he doesn\u2019t expect to cancel the upcoming St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade.\n\n\u201cWe have parades all the time. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll end. Certainly we recognized the public safety challenges and issues that relate to them,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, donated $100,000 to Lopez-Galvan\u2019s family. Two $50,000 donations were posted Friday under the singer\u2019s name on a GoFundMe page. Swift\u2019s representative confirmed the donations to Variety, the trade publication reported, and The Associated Press independently verified the posts.\n\nKansas City has long struggled with gun violence, and in 2020 it was among nine cities targeted by the U.S. Justice Department in an effort to crack down on violent crime. In 2023, the city matched a record with 182 homicides, most of which involved guns.\n\nLucas has joined with mayors across the country in calling for new laws to reduce gun violence, including mandating universal background checks.\n\n___\n\nSalter reported from O\u2019Fallon, Missouri. McFetridge reported from Des Moines, Iowa.",

    "text": "Netflix\n\nThere's 1 Thing About This 'Love Is Blind' Season That Is A Little Off\n\nThis experiment wasn\u2019t for Jimmy. He\u2019s so focused on looks that he can\u2019t even see Chelsea for who she is. And Chelsea knows that he\u2019s not attracted to her, but is in denial about it and keeps looking for validation from Jimmy. And Jimmy keeps lying to her (and himself) about how much he\u2019s into her. That\u2019s how we keep getting these weird-ass responses from him, like him saying he noticed her teeth (not smile!) first, but really it was how big her boobs were.\n\n\n\nJimmy had an idea of what he thought Chelsea looked like and that and that was a big reason he chose her \u2014 on top of her not challenging him like Jessica did. It\u2019s just like, if physical attraction is that important to you, then this isn\u2019t the show for you. \u2014 Taryn\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s blowing my mind how this entire season is so focused on looks compared to past seasons, which obviously defeats the entire purpose of the show. Jimmy is focused solely on how Chelsea looks compared to Jessica. Clay is focused on how AD looks. I don\u2019t think Kenneth is into Brittany and it seems like it has to do with attraction. This entire cast is proving that love is definitely not blind. I will say I find Jimmy particularly egregious, and this entire thing is really embarrassing for Chelsea because she is really trying to convince herself (and us) that he is attracted to her when nearly everything he says, along with his actions, make it pretty obvious he doesn\u2019t think she is hot enough for him. Which is funny, because I think they\u2019re at the same level of attractiveness. \u2014 Cambria\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve known that love isn\u2019t blind like we know the sky is blue, which makes it increasingly difficult for me to keep watching these shows, but I digress. Your assessments were spot on, Taryn and Cambria. \u2014 Ruth\n\n\n\nI think I mentioned this when we covered last season, but I\u2019ll say it again \u2014 I honestly think contestants on this show sneakily ask and then imply whether or not they\u2019re hot in the pods. I think Jeramey asked Sarah Ann how many Instagram followers she had, which is a vague way to gauge how attractive she potentially could be. More followers = hotter. Bartise was likely more into Raven in Season 3 when she admitted to him that she worked a side hustle as a bottle girl and Shake asked Deepti in Season 2 if she could sit on his shoulders. I\u2019m glad AD never shared that she used to be a professional cheerleader, because Clay would\u2019ve been even more superficial than he already was. I\u2019m just saying, contestants have proven for QUITE A WHILE that looks are important to them. This whole show is BS (but I love it). \u2014 Elyse\n\n\n\nI guess it just feels like they\u2019re saying the quiet part out loud this season, when in past seasons, it was a little more subtle. \u2014 Cambria",

    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nUtah State\u2019s Board of Education voted to censure one of its members on Wednesday over a recent social media post in which she questioned a teenage girl\u2019s gender, resulting in online harassment and attacks against the girl.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the board wrote that the member, Natalie Cline, will be barred from attending board meetings and stripped of her committee assignments. While the board has no power or authority to unseat an elected official, it also urged Cline to resign from her position by Feb. 19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe censure decision follows an investigation into a controversial Facebook post from Cline last week, in which she shared a flyer of a high school girls basketball team that included a photo. In the caption, Cline wrote \u201cGirls\u2019 basketball\u2026\u201d \u2014 implying that the teenage girl in the photo was transgender.\n\nThe post, which has now been taken down, garnered hateful comments in which users attacked the teenager in the photo and discussed personal information about her. The harassment that the girl received was so severe that she needed police protection, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.\n\nThe board\u2019s decision to censure Cline was made in order to uphold the its policy and bylaws, which state that \u201cmembers shall respect the privacy of students, USBE employees, and school level employees, including refraining from direct and indirect identification of such, in a negative light in any public setting, venue, or platform where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Board would like to extend its deepest apologies to those harmed by this conduct, in particular the student who was targeted because of Member Cline\u2019s post,\u201d the board wrote in its statement Wednesday. \u201cNo individual, especially a child, should be subject to such comments and judgment. We hope that the actions taken today can provide support for the student and the family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCline did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn a Facebook post earlier on Wednesday, Cline claimed that the board\u2019s process of ousting her was \u201celection interference\u201d and that she was not afforded due process.\n\n\u201cI look forward to hearing from the @utboardofed and participating in a fair process that reflects the due process that must be afforded me due to the accusations made against me,\u201d she wrote in the post.\n\nCline had apologized to the teenage girl and her family last week in a statement after taking down the original post, apologizing for the negative attention and derogatory comments that came their way as a result of her post.\n\nBut the official still defended her actions, pointing out that her original post never claimed that the teenager was a boy but that she \u201cdoes have a larger build, like her parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in strange times when it is normal to pause and wonder if people are what they say they are because of the push to normalize transgenderism in our society. But that is definitely not the case with this student\u2026\u201d she wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCline\u2019s post went on to place blame on the transgender community for the incident, stating that incorrectly assuming the girl\u2019s gender was \u201ca sad consequence of the trans movement being foisted upon us, which puts us all in a difficult spot. Nobody wants to question if a kid is the gender they say they are.\u201d\n\nIn 2022, Utah passed legislation barring transgender girls from playing in female sports, but the law was reversed by a judge months later.\n\nThese efforts to restrict transgender people from participating in school sports at the K-12 or collegiate levels have been replicated in other states across the country.\n\nProponents of such bans argue that transgender women would dominate cisgender women in sports, while opponents say that they unfairly target and discriminate against transgender students. For instance, in Kentucky, an anti-transgender sports bill was passed even though there was only one known transgender athlete playing sports in the entire state.\n\nAt least 22 states in the U.S. introduced anti-transgender sports bills in 2023. This year, 44 bills have been introduced in states, several of which are advancing.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "The author and her husband, Charlie. Photo by Dan Brownstein\n\nAfter being serially dumped for two decades, I felt defeated. But when I was set up with Charlie, my now-husband at 35, I unexpectedly morphed into a hopeless romantic and began helping others find love.\n\nAs an amateur matchmaker who was on a reality TV dating show and has fixed up 30 marriages, I\u2019ve seen how difficult it can be to find the right person, especially on the dating apps. But your search doesn\u2019t have to be a nightmare.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are 10 road-tested tips for finding love offline that actually work:\n\nFix Yourself First\n\nIf you don\u2019t like your life, someone else won\u2019t mend it. You\u2019ll pick a better mate when you can be a better mate.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re emotionally messy and confused, your love life will reflect the mess and chaos,\u201d Patty Gross, a licensed social worker (LSW) told me. She insisted that improving my psyche, home, job, finances, style or education upped my odds of finding a stronger partnership.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2023 survey revealed that 28% of couples met in an educational setting \u2015 taking one class, seminar, or joining a professional group can be transformative. Three duets even met in my supportive writing workshop.\n\n\u201cPracticing self-care is essential to looking and feeling better and loving yourself,\u201d Diana Kirchner, a Florida psychologist and \u201cLove in 90 Days\u201d author, told me. \u201cHappy, healthy people have better relationships.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t Postpone Passion\n\nAfter I complained my boyfriend wasn\u2019t making me happy, my therapist said, \u201cLove doesn\u2019t make you happy. Make yourself happy. Then you\u2019ll find love.\u201d Indeed, when I landed a nicer apartment and an exciting job as a book critic, I met my husband \u2015 a big reader and fan of my column.\n\nMy friend Randy originally sparked with her husband after traveling solo to Poland to find her family roots (a trip he was fascinated to hear about). My colleague Kenan met his Sarajevan wife while promoting his ambitious book project on Bosnia.\n\nPeople pursuing their dreams attract partners faster, Connecticut psychiatrist Vatsal Thakkar told me. \u201cWhen mating, different species show off health and virility in varied ways: a peacock displays feathers; male rams fight, ramming horns into each other to show dominance; humans know exhibiting ambition, and drive can be alluring.\u201d\n\nContra-Date\n\nThis term, which means switching up the kind of person you pursue, was coined by dating site Plenty of Fish. So if you\u2019re 35 and usually stick to your peers, try someone who is 25 or 50. New Yorkers who consider New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania residents have thousands more potential mates.\n\n\u201cRealtors often say, \u2018Buyers are liars,\u2019 for insisting on what they want in a home, then falling in love with the opposite. It\u2019s the same with singles,\u201d Rachel Greenwald, a professional matchmaker whose website boasts having helped 908 couples marry, told me during a recent phone call.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey can get preoccupied with externals. Sometimes they\u2019re stuck, repeating criteria important in their teens or 20s. But if you\u2019re older, self-supporting, divorced or widowed, your needs change. It may no longer matter if you share religion, politics, financial or co-parenting attitudes. Sometimes the only remedy is to break everything,\u201d she said.\n\nRecycle Romance\n\nAnyone kind from your past you regret leaving? Check social media to see if they\u2019re currently available. While re-meeting an ex may be remind you why you split, sometimes love blossoms anew.\n\nBen Affleck and J-Lo reconnected 20 years after their broken engagement. Recovering from her public split with former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Donna Hanover reunited with her high school sweetheart at 53. My colleague Michelle Mead wrote to the college beau she\u2019d broken off with, and they married 40 years later. Judy Burdick, my Michigan bestie, is now engaged to the boy she\u2019d danced with at his Midwest Bar Mitzvah. Charlie and I actually split for a few years when dating and re-met when the timing was riper.\n\n\u201cThe more experience we get, the better perspective,\u201d said Dr. Thakkar. \u201cReviewing previous choices may reveal the futility of pursuing unreachable ideals.\u201d\n\nMine Your Social Circle\n\nAsk relatives, comrades and coworkers if they know someone single and wonderful; if you already have, check back. Mention that you\u2019re still solo or on your own again, and see if anyone new comes to mind. A former boss set me up with Charlie, and a magazine editor I freelanced for introduced me to her buddy Jon, his runner-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve rarely initiated a conversation about anyone\u2019s relationship status, yet I\u2019ve set up high school and college classmates, my brother, my husband\u2019s sister, my book editor and my dentist \u2014 all who asked me. The worst response you\u2019ll hear is, \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone.\u201d The best is, \u201cHey, I just thought of someone you might like.\u201d\n\nHire A Helper\n\nYou\u2019ll need cash and connections to work with Netflix\u2019s popular Indian and Jewish Matchmaking stars or the Millionaire Matchmaker. Yet one session with a relationship guru may be worth spending a few hundred dollars.\n\n\u201cDating apps can feel robotic, depressing and addictive,\u201d Eddie Hernandez, a photographer and dating coach for straight and gay couples in San Francisco, emailed me. \u201cAnonymity encourages bad etiquette. There\u2019s impatience, self-sabotage and mistakes singles make. We\u2019re hiring others for help with hair, wardrobe, public speaking, employment. Why not with love? Get a wingman to identify your blind spots \u2014 in style, first impressions, social etiquette. We discreetly help you present yourself in the best light.\u201d\n\nHernandez recommends updating your profiles and photos on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, X and TikTok, since prospective dates might Google-stalk you. For your profiles, don\u2019t use half-naked, posed, dressy, professional or misleading photos that don\u2019t look like you \u2014 or you may get ditched within 20 seconds of a first rendezvous. It\u2019s always best to look natural, candid, and like yourself.\n\nEmbrace Feedback\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to pay for advice, seek guidance from happily married people in your life who\u2019ll be honest. I told the boss who\u2019d fixed me up with Charlie, \u201cHe\u2019s smart and sweet, but not my type.\u201d She replied, \u201cYour type is neurotic, self-destructive and not interested in you. Go out with him again.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been thankful every day for 27 years I had someone from a different generation who\u2019d challenged my preconceptions and pushed me to give him a second chance.\n\nColleagues helped me plan a multi-tiered approach (setups, revisiting exes who were available, socializing at sports games and bars, hosting singles soirees), and they warned me that, like job searches and house hunts, finding the right person might require creativity.\n\n\u201cDating is a game of numbers,\u201d said Kirchner, who recommends getting a \u201clove mentor\u201d and going on casual coffee dates with several suitors while keeping your clothes on. \u201cThen politely back away from anyone who doesn\u2019t want what you want.\u201d\n\nAxe Expectations\n\nSeeking a dramatic, idealized liaison with your true soulmate can be frustrating \u2014 and futile. (\u201cRomeo and Juliet isn\u2019t a love story. It\u2019s a 3-day relationship between a 13-year-old and 17-year-old that caused six deaths,\u201d the meme goes.) Just aim to make a new friend.\n\nOr could an old friendship catch fire? My college roommate\u2019s mom fell for a bridge player she knew during the pandemic, when all she originally was looking for was worthy partner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne person who will satisfy all emotional, physical and spiritual needs is a tall order,\u201d New York psychotherapist Esther Perel, whose bestseller \u201cMating in Captivity\u201d was translated into 25 languages, emailed me. \u201cThose with more social resources on their own do better in marriage\u2026 Instead of looking for someone who checks all the boxes, focus on a person you can imagine writing a story with that entails edits and revisions.\u201d\n\nAssuming a partner can satisfy your every single need as a best friend, confidant, co-parent and companion sets you up for disappointment, Chicago marriage and family therapist David Klow, notes in his book, \u201cYou are Not Crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinding alternative ways to have others in your life frees up your relationship to be a source of joy rather than a letdown.\u201d (Enter: friends, relatives, coworkers, coach and therapist.)\n\nShrink Your Checklist And Sarcasm\n\nWhen someone new asked if I\u2019d set her up, I immediately began brainstorming... until she added he\u2019d have to be tall, smart, successful, handsome, her age, in a similar field, residing nearby, and wanting children immediately. By item six, she\u2019d lost me. The more specifics she named, the more it seemed she wanted a fantasy, not a human.\n\nStick with three essentials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a restaurant menu where you order someone of a certain height, background, education and profession,\u201d Rachel Greenwald, author of \u201cFind a Husband After 35 (Using What I Learned at Harvard Business School),\u201d told me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe more open-minded you are, the more chances for love,\u201d she added.\n\nSuppress the urge to post polarizing political rants and save the vitriolic proclamations like, \u201cI don\u2019t want another selfish, narcissistic, emasculating monster,\u201d for your next therapy session.\n\nLeave Your Couch\n\nWorking remotely has benefits, yet it\u2019s doubtful you\u2019ll meet a mate lying around your living room in sweats. I\u2019ve introduced guests at parties, charity functions, readings and singles events, many who bravely came alone.\n\n\u201cBeing tech dependent and socially isolated, modern dating can be hard,\u201d Francesca Hogi, an LA lawyer turned love coach who lives with her boyfriend and her dog, wrote in an email to me.\n\n\u201cPeople expect matchmakers to have the secret sauce \u2014 a magical portal to pull out the perfect partner. But they\u2019re not a substitute for taking action yourself.\u201d\n\nSo, volunteer at a local soup kitchen, hospital or museum; get a membership to a new gym; join a softball or bowling team; join a book, hiking or cycling club, group travel tour, or new house of worship. One hopeful study revealed that 27% of couples met at bars and restaurants, so instead of texting Uber Eats, consider getting dressed and going out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLong before Taylor Swift made her name chronicling love gone wrong, I was able to turn all of my previous bad breakups into a memoir of heartache, with a wonderful spouse in the last chapter. As we prepare to celebrate our 28th anniversary, I can say for sure: Love gone right is both worth the wait and the struggle.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story you\u2019d like to see published on HuffPost?

He\u2019s so focused on looks that he can\u2019t even see Chelsea for who she is. And Chelsea knows that he\u2019s not attracted to her, but is in denial about it and keeps looking for validation from Jimmy. And Jimmy keeps lying to her (and himself) about how much he\u2019s into her. That\u2019s how we keep getting these weird ass responses from him like him saying he noticed her teeth (not smile!) first, but really it was how big her boobs were.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJimmy had an idea of what he thought Chelsea looked like and that and that was a big reason he chose her \u2014 on top of her not challenging him like Jessica did. It\u2019s just like if physical attraction is that important to you, then this isn\u2019t the show for you. \u2014 Taryn\n\nIt\u2019s blowing my mind how this entire season is so focused on looks compared to past seasons, which obviously defeats the entire purpose of the show. Jimmy is focused solely on how Chelsea looks compared to Jessica. Clay is focused on how AD looks. I don\u2019t think Kenneth is into Brittany and it seems like it has to do with attraction. This entire cast is proving that love is definitely not blind. I will say I find Jimmy particularly egregious, and this entire thing is really embarrassing for Chelsea because she is really trying to convince herself (and us) that he is attracted to her when nearly everything he says, along with his actions, make it pretty obvious he doesn\u2019t think she is hot enough for him. Which is funny, because I think they\u2019re at the same level of attractiveness. \u2014 Cambria\n\nWe\u2019ve known that love isn\u2019t blind like we know the sky is blue, which makes it increasingly difficult for me to keep watching these shows, but I digress. Your assessments were spot on, Taryn and Cambria. \u2014 Ruth\n\nI think I mentioned this when we covered last season, but I\u2019ll say it again \u2014 I honestly think contestants on this show sneakily ask and then imply whether or not they\u2019re hot in the pods. I think Jeramey asked Sarah Ann how many Instagram followers she had, which is a vague way to gauge how attractive she potentially could be. The more followers = the hotter. Bartise was likely more into Raven in Season 3 when she admitted to him that she worked a side hustle as a bottle girl and Shake asked Deepti in Season 2 if she could sit on his shoulders. I\u2019m glad AD never shared that she used to be a professional cheerleader, because Clay would\u2019ve been even more superficial than he already was. I\u2019m just saying, contestants have proven for QUITE A WHILE that looks are important to them. This whole show is bs (but I love it) \u2014 Elyse\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI guess it just feels like they\u2019re saying the quiet part out loud this season when in past seasons it was a little more subtle. \u2014 Cambria\n\nIf you want more interviews, pop culture rundowns and conversations too layered for a social media thread to tackle, subscribe to \u201cI Know That\u2019s Right.\u201d With new episodes dropping each week, this show is sure to keep you entertained, informed and shouting \u201cI know that\u2019s right\u201d every now and then.",

Your assessments were spot on, Taryn and Cambria. \u2014 Ruth\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think I mentioned this when we covered last season, but I\u2019ll say it again \u2014 I honestly think contestants on this show sneakily ask and then imply whether or not they\u2019re hot in the pods. I think Jeramey asked Sarah Ann how many Instagram followers she had, which is a vague way to gauge how attractive she potentially could be. The more followers = the hotter. Bartise was likely more into Raven in Season 3 when she admitted to him that she worked a side hustle as a bottle girl and Shake asked Deepti in Season 2 if she could sit on his shoulders. I\u2019m glad AD never shared that she used to be a professional cheerleader, because Clay would\u2019ve been even more superficial than he already was. I\u2019m just saying, contestants have proved for QUITE A WHILE that looks are important to them. This whole show is B.S. (but I love it) \u2014 Elyse\n\nI guess it just feels like they\u2019re saying the quiet part out loud this season, when in past seasons it was a little more subtle. \u2014 Cambria\n\nListen to the latest episode of \u201cI Know That\u2019s Right\u201d below:\n\nIf you want more interviews, pop culture rundowns and conversations too layered for a social media thread to tackle, subscribe to \u201cI Know That\u2019s Right.\u201d With new episodes dropping each week, this show is sure to keep you entertained, informed and shouting \u201cI know that\u2019s right!\u201d every now and then.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nWe all know to watch our language when we\u2019re around kids: no swearing, no adults-only topics, no gossip you wouldn\u2019t want them repeating to anyone else. If we slip on any of these, we generally realize it right away and can follow up with an \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d\n\nBut there are other things that we should avoid saying to kids that we\u2019re unlikely to notice because they\u2019re so common and seem innocuous. Many of us repeat them habitually. These phrases can cause confusion for kids or muddle the messages we\u2019re trying to send, and experts recommend that we avoid them when addressing our children. Here\u2019s what they are:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. \u201cCould you/do you mind/will you please/can you?\u201d\n\nMany of us are in the habit of saying phrases like these in order to sound polite or deferential, but they can cause confusion for kids. If you\u2019re giving an instruction, it\u2019s better to do so without asking a question.\n\nBeginning with an interrogative \u201cimplies an element of choice, leaving the child room to say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Amy Jackson, chief early learning strategy officer at Primrose Schools, told HuffPost. Instead, use a simple command: \u201cPick up the blocks, please\u201d or \u201cYou need to pick up the blocks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother option would be \u201cIt\u2019s time to pick up the blocks.\u201d This phrasing communicates that the parent isn\u2019t making the child do something on a whim, but simply communicating that now is the time in the day\u2019s schedule to clean up.\n\n2. \u201cI\u2019m not going to help you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s good to encourage kids to do things on their own, but this phrasing \u201ccan be discouraging and lead to the child not coming to the parent later,\u201d Whitney Raglin Bignall, associate clinical director of On Our Sleeves, explained to HuffPost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, Raglin Bignall suggested \u201cTry first and if it doesn\u2019t work we can talk it through.\u201d This lets the child know you believe in them but are there to offer support when needed.\n\n3. \u201cGood job!\u201d\n\nMany of us grew up regulating our behavior to elicit this kind of praise from adults. But this vague commendation isn\u2019t specific enough for kids to really benefit. \u201cIt gives little insight into what they are doing well,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nWhen they\u2019re doing something right, be specific so they\u2019ll know which behaviors to repeat in the future. You could say something like, \u201cI see you picking up the blocks and putting them in the bins, thank you for helping us keep this space clean\u201d or \u201cGood job throwing that away.\u201d\n\n4. \u201cI want you to be good.\u201d\n\nMany of us have memories of being sternly told that we\u2019d \u201cbetter be on our best behavior\u201d before entering someone\u2019s home, or in other situations. But, again, this instruction isn\u2019t specific enough to be helpful to kids. They lack experience and won\u2019t always know what \u201cgood\u201d behavior looks like in a given situation.\n\nInstead, tell the child exactly what you need them to do: \u201cI need you to stay next to the cart and only touch the food we are going to buy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \u201cCalm down.\u201d\n\nIt can feel like the most obvious instruction to give a shrieking child, but it simply doesn\u2019t work. \u201cNo one has ever calmed down by being told to do so,\u201d Jackson said.\n\n\u201cChildren need to know it is okay to have big feelings and be taught ways to self-regulate. Telling them to calm down, stop crying or get over it is assuming they can or know how to,\u201d she continued.\n\nA hug, a few deep breaths together or redirection may help kids regulate when they are having intense feelings. You may also find that your own calm, continued presence is enough to help them.\n\n6. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\nWhile an issue may seem trivial to us, that doesn\u2019t mean it feels trivial to our child. \u201cThese statements often invalidate the child\u2019s feelings,\u201d Raglin Bignall said.\n\n\u201cIt can lead to them feeling dismissed or believing their feelings are not valued. It also may cause a child to second guess themselves and the validity of their feelings/experience,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead, try an open-ended question such as, \u201cThis seems really important to you \u2014 tell me why you\u2019re upset,\u201d Raglin Bignall suggested.\n\nd3sign via Getty Images Telling your kids something isn't a \"big deal\" can invalidate their emotions.\n\n7. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want kids to feel punished for finally opening up,\u201d Raglin Bignall said. We also want to keep the focus on their feelings, not our own, by praising them for saying something and letting them know that we are there to listen.\n\nYou could respond instead with, \u201cThanks so much for coming to me about this,\u201d she suggested.\n\n8. Ending a direction or statement with \u201cOK?\u201d\n\nMany people are in the habit of tacking the question \u201cOK?\u201d to the end of a request in order to soften it or appear accommodating. But kids may not be able to pick up on this. Give clear directions for what you need the child to do and end there.\n\nLikewise, if you are making a declarative statement such as \u201cMommy\u2019s going to leave now,\u201d you don\u2019t want to finish with an \u201cOK?\u201d You\u2019re not asking the child for permission or feedback, you\u2019re simply telling them what\u2019s going to happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. \u201cStop it.\u201d\n\nWhile sometimes we need to prevent our kids from doing something dangerous, when it comes to less urgent behavioral issues the general rule is to use affirmative rather than negative commands, telling kids what to do instead of what not to do.\n\nAgain, it helps to be as specific as possible: \u201cWalk next to me\u201d or \u201cKeep the ball on the ground,\u201d are examples that Raglin Bignall gave. You may hear teachers using phrases such as \u201cWalking feet\u201d instead of \u201cDon\u2019t run,\u201d or \u201cInside voices\u201d instead of \u201cStop yelling.\u201d Phrasing requests in this way helps you keep your tone more positive, too.\n\n10. \u201cWas that a good choice?\u201d\n\nWe want kids to reflect on their behavior, but this particular phrase \u201csends an indirect message to the child that they are choosing to be \u2018bad,\u2019\u201d Jackson said.\n\nInstead, ask questions that will help the child come up with possible solutions on their own, and affirm that the child is always good even if they sometimes make mistakes with their behavior.\n\n11. \u201cUse your words.\u201d\n\nThis command doesn\u2019t acknowledge that a child\u2019s distress is a result of their limited ability to communicate what they\u2019re feeling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf a child knew the words to express their feelings, they likely would,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nInstead, she recommended, \u201cAsk open-ended and simple questions, in a calm and controlled manner such as: \u2018What do you need?\u2019 \u2018How can I help?\u2019 \u2018Tell me what happened\u2019 \u2018Do you feel _____?\u2019\u201d\n\nHelp the child figure out what they can do when they have feelings or anger, sadness or frustration. \u201cPractice with role play and talk openly about what they could do differently next time,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nRemember when talking to your child that it isn\u2019t only the words you use, but the way you say them as well as other signals you may be sending. If you as a parent are feeling stress, kids will pick up on it. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to say that you need a minute to calm down or (when safe) to step away briefly. This gives you a chance to think over what you\u2019re about to say, and it models for your kids how to regulate their own emotions.\n\nWhile it can be a challenge, staying calm when your child is upset \u201cis what helps them to know that no matter how they are feeling they can navigate hard things,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nSupport HuffPost A Healthier, Happier 2024 At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nU.S. Border Patrol agents across ranks and regions routinely referred to unauthorized migrants using the derogatory slur \u201ctonk,\u201d according to emails and text messages disclosed to HuffPost under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nHigher-ups in Washington and within the Border Patrol itself have told agents that discriminatory and racist language undermines the agency\u2019s mission \u2014 at times singling out the term \u201ctonk\u201d specifically and threatening disciplinary action for its use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut its use remains surprisingly routine, even in government communications that in some cases bore email signatures of supervising agents, the documents show. HuffPost submitted the FOIA request in 2020, asking for agency communications that included the word. The agency began a partial release of the documents last week.\n\nThe widespread use of the term hints at the hostility many within the agency\u2019s rank-and-file hold for the people they police, who mostly are migrants fleeing humanitarian crises and economic disasters in Latin America.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a HuffPost request asking whether any Border Patrol staff members have been disciplined for using the term.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s Pretty Bad\u2019\n\nThe word \u201ctonk\u201d does not have a clear origin. Some say it\u2019s an acronym for some variation of \u201cTraveler, Origin Not Known\u201d or \u201cTraveler Outside Native Country.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe broadest consensus among those familiar with it, however, is that the slur comes from the sound made by slamming a heavy-duty flashlight or baton over a migrant\u2019s head.\n\nThough no one can say for sure, the flashlight definition has adherents within the agency. In an email with the subject line \u201cTonk,\u201d a Border Patrol agent in the Spokane, Washington, region asked whether someone \u201d\u2018found\u2019 that head wound with his maglite.\u201d (The names in the documents released to HuffPost were redacted.)\n\nWhen a supervising agent in New Mexico sent an email in January 2019 about a \u201creally bad memo,\u201d the recipient responded that he bought a T-shirt for a colleague \u201cthat looks like the following... It will give you a good laugh I hope.\u201d\n\nA prevalent theory about the origin of the slur \"tonk,\" widely used by Border Patrol agents, is that it's the sound of bashing a migrant's head with a flashlight. Border Patrol email image\n\nThe term does not describe a specific race. Bilingual agents typing in idiomatic Spanglish used it in an agency where roughly 50% of employees are Hispanic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome Border Patrol employees, however, appeared to use the term in ways that appeared overtly racist or flatly discriminatory, particularly when sharing news stories.\n\nAn email sent by the watch commander for the Border Patrol\u2019s Wellton Station in the Yuma Sector in Arizona carried the subject line \u201cAmerican TONK\u201d and the comment \u201cThe future...\u201d with a link to a news story about a brown-skinned woman with a Spanish surname breastfeeding her child at Disneyland.\n\nA text chain between Border Patrol employees described migrants not just as \u201ctonks\u201d but also as \u201can influx of rats\u201d from \u201cwhatamala, el salvado and hondodas.\u201d In another text chain, Border Patrol personnel mocked a co-worker for \u201cmarrying a tonk\u201d because \u201che cant find a legal chick here WOW.\u201d\n\nThe term has always bothered some within law enforcement, especially after the historically siloed Border Patrol was merged into the Department of Homeland Security in 2003, bringing new scrutiny to the agency.\n\nAlonzo Pe\u00f1a, a former deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, got his start in law enforcement as a customs investigator under the old Immigration and Naturalization Service. It wasn\u2019t until his bureau was merged with ICE in 2003, after the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, that he started hearing officers saying phrases like \u201cI picked up a tonk,\u201d Pe\u00f1a told HuffPost in a 2018 interview. (Pe\u00f1a died in 2019.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen he asked what \u201ctonk\u201d meant, the answer unsettled him.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s pretty bad,\u2019\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cMy initial reaction was that\u2019s an abuse of authority. Ninety-nine percent of the time, when you\u2019re dealing with illegal immigrants that you detain, they\u2019re generally compliant. They don\u2019t resist or anything like that. You don\u2019t need to hit them in the head.\u201d\n\nThe agency has repeatedly told personnel not to use insulting terms, contending that they undermine public trust in the Border Patrol.\n\n\u201cThe terms \u2018wetback,\u2019 \u2018tonk,\u2019 etc. will not be tolerated,\u201d the chief patrol agent for the McAllen Sector in Texas wrote to staff in an email dated Aug. 2, 2000. \u201cAny deviation from these instructions will be considered grounds for counseling and/or disciplinary action.\u201d The commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service sent a similar warning condemning the use of slurs in 2002, though it did not mention the term \u201ctonk\u201d specifically.\n\nGuidance from Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, stated flatly in 2019 that \u201cthe term tonk is not appropriate\u201d because it is \u201cconsidered a derogatory term and CBP does not condone its use.\u201d\n\nA U.S. Border Patrol agent in Yuma, Arizona, checks the passports of migrants after they crossed the border with Mexico on May 18, 2022. Mario Tama via Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the term is ingrained enough that agents used it casually when filing paperwork or sending routine communications.\n\nPhoto files sent by email were often named \u201ctonk.\u201d Subject lines and attached files contained terms including \u201cassaultive tonk,\u201d \u201cfreezing tonk,\u201d \u201ctonk phone\u201d and \u201cfamilia tonk.\u201d\n\n\u2033[Redacted] is gonna buy some hot pockets for the tonks,\u201d a supervising agent in Vermont wrote in a 2017 email with the subject line \u201cRE: tonk meals in [redacted].\u201d\n\nMultiple supervising agents and watch commanders used the term in written communications at stations in Arizona, New Mexico, California and Vermont.\n\nBorder Patrol employees, all of whose names were redacted, appeared aware that the public may take exception to describing migrants with slurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a heavily redacted text conversation, two Border Patrol employees appeared to criticize the terms people using \u201cLiberal logic\u201d used to describe unauthorized migrants:\n\n\u201cWOW. Pussification of America\u201d\n\n\u201cLol yup\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good with calling them Tonk\u201d\n\n\u201cWorks for me too\u201d\n\nAn Inside Term\n\nFew people outside Border Patrol circles had even heard the term until recent years.\n\nThomas Homan, the controversial hard-liner who headed Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the first year and a half of the Trump administration, cast a spotlight on the slur by allegedly using it in Washington, D.C., in front of Border Patrol outsiders, which HuffPost disclosed in April 2018. (Homan, who began his career in federal law enforcement as a Border Patrol agent, denied using the term.)\n\nA group of Democratic Congress members denounced Homan\u2019s alleged use of the term and appeared poised to grill him over it at his Senate confirmation hearing. Homan resigned two months later without going through the hearing.\n\nThe term also surfaced after Border Patrol agent Matthew Bowen faced prosecution for striking a Guatemalan migrant with a government truck in December 2017. Bowen, who pleaded guilty and received probation, had described unauthorized migrants as \u201ctonks,\u201d \u201cGuats\u201d and \u201csubhuman shit unworthy of being kindling for a fire\u201d in texts disclosed by the court.\n\nSuch slurs are likely more pervasive than the records indicate. The documents provided to HuffPost were part of an interim release. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s office that handles Freedom of Information Act requests said it is continuing to conduct searches for communications containing the term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome agents also appeared to disguise language with deliberate misspellings when typing on government-issued devices. One Border Patrol employee, for example, told another that their \u201ctext thread went dryer [sic] than your pu $$ Y.\u201d\n\nThose participating in the thread, however, appeared less concerned about their use of slurs than with profanity. The term \u201ctonks\u201d was spelled correctly \u2015 and in all caps.",

    "text": "For three days, it looked as though Rishi Sunak was having the rarest of things for him \u2013 a good week.\n\nKeir Starmer was under the cosh over Labour\u2019s woes in Rochdale and, despite predictions to the contrary by economists, inflation did not go up again when the latest figures were published on Wednesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut all that changed at 7am the next day.\n\nThat was when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) confirmed that the UK economy had shrunk by 0.3% in the final quarter of last year.\n\nAdded to the 0.1% contraction in the three months before, it means the country was officially in recession \u2013 the very thing the prime minister had promised would not happen.\n\nThen, in the early hours of Friday morning, the Tories lost two by-elections to Labour in previously-safe seats.\n\nAnd while that was not wholly unexpected, the scale of the defeats \u2013 especially in Wellingborough \u2013 confirmed the party\u2019s worst fears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis has been the position for 18 months and it\u2019s showing no sign of changing,\u201d one former Tory cabinet member told HuffPost UK then.\n\n\u201cThe by-election results have just confirmed how bad things are, but maybe more people will now realise it.\u201d\n\nElection expert Sir John Curtice said the Tories were \u201cstaring defeat in the face at the general election\u201d, not least because the party is leaking voters to both Labour and Reform UK.\n\nThe right-wing party secured 10% of the vote in Kingswood and 13% in Wellingborough \u2013 numbers to send a chill down the spine of many Conservative MPs nervously eyeing their own majorities.\n\n\u201cReform UK now have begun to put votes in the ballot box,\u201d Curtice said.\n\n\u201cThe problem that means for the Conservatives is that for every one voter who is switching to Labour, there\u2019s now another one who\u2019s switching to Reform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt means that that coalition of pro-Brexit voters that took Boris Johnson to victory in 2019 is just fragmenting further as Reform threatens to take more votes away from the Conservatives.\u201d\n\nThe end result, Curtice said, is that \u201cSir Keir Starmer looks as likely to be the next prime minister as he did 24 hours ago, if not more so\u201d.\n\nThat is despite the Labour leader enduring one of his worst weeks since taking on the job nearly four years ago.\n\nWith the U-turn on the party\u2019s pledge to spend \u00a328 billion a year on green energy projects still fresh in the memory, its campaign in the upcoming Rochdale by-election went up in smoke.\n\nA recording of Labour candidate Azhar Ali accusing Israel of allowing the October 7 attack by Hamas to take place as a pretext to invading Gaza was leaked to the Mail on Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAli issued a full apology and, initially, the party opted to stand by him.\n\nBut as Starmer swithered over what to do, more audio from the same event emerged in which Ali referred to Jewish people working in the media. Within hours, Labour had withdrawn their support for him, although it is too late to remove him from the ballot paper.\n\nHuffPost UK has been told that the party was initially urged not to axe Ali by Jewish groups, who feared it would hand an open goal to George Galloway, who is also standing in Rochdale for his British Workers Party.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want Galloway in the Commons spreading his poison,\u201d said one source.\n\nThe Labour leadership considered announcing that their candidate would not take the party whip if he won, and would also not stand at the general election. However, the emergence of the second recording made his position untenable.\n\n\u201cIf George Galloway was not a candidate then it would have been a much easier decision,\u201d said one senior Labour insider.\n\n\u201cBut showing that we\u2019re serious about tackling anti-Semitism and prioritising that above a by-election victory is a good message for us to get out there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne senior Tory MP said there was no chance of his party benefiting from the controversy.\n\n\u201cRochdale is a bubble issue - it just doesn\u2019t resonate outside Westminster,\u201d he said.\n\nThe last 48 hours also appear to have put paid to any lingering chance that Sunak might opt for a May election, the reasoning being that by going long there is always the chance of something coming up to get the Tories back in the race.\n\nBut one veteran backbencher said: \u201cI\u2019ve always been in favour of a May election as it\u2019s our best chance of getting a decent number of Tory MPs back.\u201d\n\nThe Conservatives have now been reduced to warning their former supporters that a vote for Reform simply increases the chances of a Labour government by splitting the right-wing vote.\n\nThat has led to Labour attacking Reform by insisting the party failed to meet expectations in the by-elections.\n\nOne insider said: \u201c13% in Wellingborough is an under-performance for them. Ukip came second there in 2015 with 19.6%.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut a Reform source told HuffPost UK: \u201cWe doubled our best ever result twice in one night, did better than our national polling average from a standing start, and without the clout, people, money, national recognition or local knowledge that Labour have.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s underperformed, they better watch out for when we get into our stride.\u201d\n\nFor Sunak, however, the prospect of the Tories getting into their stride this side of the general election seems like a distant one.\n\nThe PM is fond of warning that a Labour government would take the country \u201cback to square one\u201d.",

    "text": "Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny died, according to a statement from the Russia prison system on Friday. via Associated Press\n\nThe Russian prison service reported on Friday that prominent critic of Vladimir Putin, Alexei Navalny, has died.\n\nNavalny, imprisoned by Russia since January 2021, was moved to a penal colony, known as \u201cPolar Wolf\u201d, near the Arctic Circle in December last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe died after falling unconscious on a walk and medics were unable to revive him, according to the prison\u2019s statement.\n\nAs the leader of the Russia of the Future party, Navalny was known around the world for his courage and his status as the most prominent opponent to Putin\u2019s decades of rule.\n\nHere\u2019s why the news has sparked huge international upset \u2013 which Navalny\u2019s own team have suggested may have been a murder.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nNavalny, 47, was being held in a Russian penal colony in Kharp, northeast of Moscow, as part of a lengthy jail term on extremist charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Thursday, Navalny was seen on a video link, laughing about his lack of personal funds.\n\nIn a statement by the country\u2019s prison agency, the officials claimed Navalny felt unwell on a walk on Friday, and then lost consciousness. He then allegedly died.\n\nEmergency medical staff attempted to resuscitate him but were unsuccessful.\n\nThe Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cAs far as we know, in accordance with all the existing rules the Federal Penitentiary Service is checking and establishing [what happened].\u201d\n\nNavalny\u2019s wife Yulia Navalnaya said she was not certain of his death, because \u201cPutin and his government... lie incessantly\u201d.\n\nHowever, if he were dead, she told the Munich Security Conference that Putin and his entourage \u201cwill be punished for what they have done to our country, for what they have done to my family, for what they have done to my husband\u201d.\n\nNavalny\u2019s team said a lawyer is travelling to the city to find out more, and that they had not been able to independently confirm his death yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis spokesperson Kira Yarmysh wrote on X: \u201cAs soon as we have some information, we will report on it.\u201d\n\nReports of ill health have been surrounding Navalny for some time. In April last year, his spokesperson expressed fears he was being fed a slow-acting poison.\n\n'If this is true, I want Putin and everyone around him to know that they will be held accountable for everything they did to our country, to my family.'\n\n\n\nYulia Navalnaya, Alexei Navalny's wife speaks after her husband's death.\n\n\n\nMore: https://t.co/rZ0pCSkmIO\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/LymLXBIQgf \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) February 16, 2024\n\nWhy was Navalny so well-known?\n\nNavalny became famous for publicly speaking out and documenting what he described as the corruption of Putin and his elite \u2013 claims the Kremlin denied.\n\nHe told Reuters in 2011 that he was not afraid of the Kremlin, adding: \u201cI realise there is danger but why should I be afraid?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut many other opposition leaders have fled Russia over the years out of fear of Putin\u2019s system. Many of Navalny\u2019s own allies now live in exile across Europe.\n\nRussia has also accused Navalny of various charges over the last decade, all of which he dismissed as politically motivated.\n\nThe former lawyer was convicted for the fifth time in the summer over activities blamed on his organisation, the Anti-Corruption Foundation, and statements by his associates.\n\nHow has the international community responded to news of his death?\n\nThe reports of Navalny\u2019s death sparked a major international response, with some leaders openly blaming Putin.\n\nUK PM Rishi Sunak said the news was \u201cterrible\u201d, adding on social media: \u201cAs the fiercest advocate for Russian democracy, Alexei Navalny demonstrated incredible courage throughout his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy thoughts are with his wife and the people of Russia, for whom this is a huge tragedy.\u201d\n\nUS secretary of state Antony Blinken said: \u201cHis death in a Russian prison and the fixation and fear of one man only underscores the weakness and rot at the heart of the system that Putin has built. Russia is responsible for this.\u201d\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, whose country is at war with Russia, also told the media: \u201cIt is obvious for me that he was killed.\u201d\n\nFormer director of the CIA, David Petraeus, told Times Radio his death was a \u201ctragedy\u201d, and described Navalny as the \u201cmost courageous, most significant opponent of Vladimir Putin\u201d.\n\nThe Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said Navalny was a \u201cvictim of Russian fascism\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cHe will probably be remembered as the best president of Russia that Russia will never have.\u201d\n\nRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is seen on a TV screen, as he appears in a video link provided by the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service in a courtroom at Moscow City Court in Moscow, Russia, May 2023. via Associated Press\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow long has Navalny been in prison?\n\nNavalny faced various sentences and charges over the years amid Russian accusations that he is an extremist and puppet of the US intelligence agency the CIA.\n\nIn 2013, he was sentenced to a five years imprisonment over embezzlement, despite absence of evidence pointing to any wrongdoing. He was later released, and came second in Moscow\u2019s mayoral election.\n\nIn 2014, he was placed under house arrest, which he frequently disobeyed. He was retried in 2017 and found guilty of embezzlement.\n\nHe was then evacuated to Germany in August 2020 after being poisoned with what Western lab tests later concluded was the Novichok nerve agent.\n\nThe incident made international news \u2013 the US, the UK and other countries sanctioned top Russian officials in response.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kremlin denied trying to kill him and said there was no evidence he was poisoned with a nerve agent.\n\nAfter he recovered, Navalny chose to return to Moscow in January 2021 \u2013 and was quickly detained by law enforcement agents, allegedly for failing to appear at a parole hearing. He was sentenced to two and a half years.\n\nHe was sentenced to a further nine years at a maximum security facility on fraud and contempt charges in March 2022.\n\nAs of February 2024, he was facing a total prison sentence which meant he would have been in jail until he was 74.\n\nRados\u0142aw Sikorski(Polish Foreign Minister): \"Alexei Navalny is the victim of Russian fascism.

Both were also hit with $4 million fines.\n\nOver the course of a 44-day civil trial, New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 office accused Trump of grossly exaggerating his wealth in order to secure favorable business loans by deceiving banks and insurers.\n\nThat includes overvaluing Mar-a-Lago by as much as 2,300%, for example, and falsely claiming his penthouse in Trump Tower was three times larger than it actually was.\n\nJames initially argued Trump and his affiliated businesses should disgorge $250 million, only to increase the figure to $370 million in a post-trial brief.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe amount is no arbitrary figure: The attorney general\u2019s office estimates Trump\u2019s fraud yielded at least to $168 million in illegal gains on his loan to purchase 40 Wall Street, $139 million related to the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., $60 million from the sale of Ferry Point golf club and $2.5 million in bonuses paid to accomplices.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron found in an earlier part of the trial that Trump had indeed committed fraud for years; all that remained was to tally up the damages.\n\n\u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Engoron concluded in his 35-page September ruling.\n\n\u201cIn defendants\u2019 world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party\u2019s lies,\u201d Engoron wrote. \u201cThat is a fantasy world, not the real world.\u201d\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks to the media at a Washington hotel on Tuesday, Jan. 9, 2024. AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefence attorney Chris Kise blamed Trump\u2019s accountants for the fraud, describing the case against his client as \u201cmanufactured to pursue a political agenda\u201d.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump relied on multimillion-dollar accountants at Mazars,\u201d Kise said in his closing statement. Kise suggested that, instead of punishing Trump, he \u201cshould get a medal\u201d for his business acumen.\n\nMazars cut ties with Trump in 2022, warning at the time that the financial statements it prepared for Trump from 2011 through 2020 \u201cshould no longer be relied upon\u201d.\n\nWhile on the stand as a witness, Trump repeatedly pointed to what he called a \u201cdisclaimer clause\u201d appended to those statements that he believed absolved him of all responsibility for their accuracy.\n\n\u201cWe would call it a worthless statement clause,\u201d he said at one point, seeking to diminish the value of the fraudulent documents. \u201cThey were not really documents that the banks paid much attention to.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEngoron dismissed the argument in a pre-trial ruling.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 reliance on these \u2018worthless\u2019 disclaimers is worthless,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe \u2018worthless clause\u2019 does not say what the defendants say it says, does not rise to the level of an enforceable disclaimer, and cannot be used to insulate fraud.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the months-long trial, Trump complained frequently on social media about the lack of a jury, conveniently ignoring the fact that his lawyers hadn\u2019t attempted to request one.\n\nHe also repeatedly called it a \u201choax\u201d, \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d, in addition to attacking Engoron and other court staffers on social media. Trump repeatedly violated a gag order intended to curtail those attacks, then demanded a mistrial, claiming in part that the order violated his First Amendment rights to free speech.\n\nIn additional attempts to dismiss the suit, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued there wasn\u2019t evidence that Trump\u2019s actions had caused public harm and that the statute of limitations had expired for many of the allegations.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Photo: Dusan Stankovic via Getty Images / HuffPost \"Though I do regret waiting so long to come out, it was the right decision for me to wait until I was in a space where I felt safe,\" says author Lola M\u00e9ndez.\n\nI came out as bisexual when I was 30, and now identify as pansexual, but it wasn\u2019t the result of some \u201caha\u201d moment. I had known for 15 years that I was attracted to more than just cisgender men, but as a Latina woman, I was wary of going public about having yet another marginalised identity. I didn\u2019t need statistics to tell me that I\u2019d be \u201cothered\u201d even more than I already am. So at the time, I felt that staying quiet about my sexuality would be my best bet.\n\nAs one of the only Latinas at my Kansas high school in the early aughts, I experienced xenophobia regularly. I had slurs written on my locker. Another time, school officers came to my house to question me after someone had anonymously made bomb threats at school. And once, the vice principal complimented my English despite me being a student at his school for three years \u2014 and not in a program for English as a second language.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the same time, I learned personally how sexism influenced the way that my achievements were measured compared with those of my male counterparts. I often felt as if I was considered lesser than my male classmates by educators despite skipping a grade, receiving excellent marks, and scoring high on standardised tests.\n\nWhen I started to have crushes as a teenager, they were on both boys and girls, but I didn\u2019t let myself explore those feelings for a decade. Even then, at 25, when I started matching with women on dating apps, I never got the courage to go on a date with any of them.\n\nBecause I\u2019m femme and straight-passing, I was able to mask myself as a heterosexual person, which kept me safe \u2014 but it quietly ate away at my soul.\n\n\u201cNot allowing yourself to be fully authentic by hiding your sexuality can affect self-esteem, identity formation, and overall well-being, which may increase stress, anxiety and depression,\u201d says Marina Kerlow, a Maryland-based marriage and family therapist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, queer Black people, Indigenous people and people of colour, Kerlow tells me, may choose to conceal their sexual orientation as \u201ca form of self-preservation\u201d within a society that frequently subjects them to multiple layers of discrimination and violence. My focus was on maintaining autonomy over an aspect of my identity in a world where I often felt powerless.\n\nBut playing that role took a toll on me. Concealing our sexuality can cause a sense of inauthenticity because we\u2019re essentially living incongruently with our true selves, says Niloufar Esmaeilpour, a mental health counsellor based in Vancouver, Canada, who founded Lotus Therapy. But, Esmaeilpour adds, hiding our sexual orientation can indeed be a survival strategy for queer minorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to avoid confrontation, discrimination and potential harm,\u201d she says.\n\nIn 2020, I finally felt safe to come out to family and friends, as well as publicly. At the time I was living in my fatherland of Uruguay, where same-sex activity has been legal (with an age of consent) since 1934. As I began a relationship with my first girlfriend, it felt liberating to finally live my truth and to do so in a place where both society and legislation are supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. I now live in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, a location I chose as my new home base since it\u2019s also very queer-friendly.\n\nThough I\u2019ve come this far, I know that there are so many other people of color like me out there who have spent years worrying about living openly queer lives.\n\n\u201cHearing explicitly racist comments, microaggressions and prejudice were things I experienced growing up. I knew how it felt to be \u2018different,\u2019\u201d says Jamie-Lukas Campbell, an American based in Ireland and the founder of the TUS Initiative, which creates solutions to help marginalised folks with \u201ctaking up space.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI stayed in the closet because I didn\u2019t want to be the recipient of discrimination and judgment more than what I had already been subjected to for being Black.\u201d\n\nFor Campbell, the fear of facing more than one type of discrimination created a heightened sense of vulnerability.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t hide my Blackness but I could conceal my same-sex attraction,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cThe closet shielded me from the double weight of being Black and gay.\u201d\n\nI get it. Regardless of how solidly we own our identities and how proud we are of our cultures, having multiple marginalised identities can condition us to feel like we don\u2019t fit \u2014 and like we\u2019re never good enough. I\u2019m seen in halves \u2014 half Indigenous Latina, half white; half gay, half straight \u2014 but also not Indigenous enough, not white enough, not gay enough, and not straight enough to belong to those communities. Coping with that constant sense of being an outsider can feel really heavy.\n\n\u201cThis can manifest as hyperawareness in social situations, anticipating discrimination, or worrying about personal safety, which diverts mental resources away from other cognitive tasks,\u201d Esmaeilpour says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough I do regret waiting so long to come out, it was the right decision for me to wait until I was in a space where I felt safe, around people who would help me thrive. Queer BIPOC have every right to come out of their own accord. There\u2019s no shame in not being publicly queer if you\u2019re worried that your safety will be in jeopardy. Coming out has been a tool of empowerment for me and permitted me to live authentically.",

    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nGreek parliament on Thursday approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, making history as the first majority Christian Orthodox country and the first in southeast Europe to do so.\n\nThe legislation, which also recognizes adoption rights for gay couples, faced strong opposition from the powerful Greek church, religious groups and some politicians, including by members of the country\u2019s center-right governing party New Democracy, like former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreece\u2019s three far-right parties as well as the Communist Party also opposed the reforms.\n\nBut Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was still able to garner enough support for the legislation after securing the backing of enough MPs from four left-wing parties, including Syriza and Pasok.\n\nA supporter of the same-sex marriage bill, celebrates the legislation's passage during a rally at central Syntagma Square, in Athens, Greece, on Feb. 15, 2024. Michael Varaklas via Associated Press\n\nOut of 300 members of parliament, 175 voted for the bill, while 77 voted against it. Additionally, 46 MPs skipped the vote and two voted present.\n\n\u201cThis is a milestone for human rights, reflecting today\u2019s Greece - a progressive, and democratic country, passionately committed to European values,\u201d Mitsotakis wrote on X following the bill\u2019s passage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vote has passed: as of tonight, Greece is proud to become the 16th EU country to legislate marriage equality. This is a milestone for human rights, reflecting today\u2019s Greece - a progressive, and democratic country, passionately committed to European values. \u2014 Prime Minister GR (@PrimeministerGR) February 15, 2024\n\nThe legislation is now headed to Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou\u2019s desk for signature.\n\nSupporters of the legislation gathered outside the Greek parliament Thursday evening to celebrate the milestone vote.\n\nCrowds celebrate passing of same-sex civil marriage bill in Athens, Greece. https://t.co/Lsamb8FAqt pic.twitter.com/tQZfz2TtXo \u2014 Sky News (@SkyNews) February 16, 2024\n\nUnder the new bill, gay couples are still not allowed to have children through a surrogate or assisted reproduction.\n\nUnder existing rules, having a child through a surrogate is only allowed for women who are unable to have their own children due to health issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreece legalised same-sex civil partnerships in 2015 but only biological parents were recognised as legal guardians of children, leaving many gay couples in limbo. While that measure was opposed by conservatives at the time, Mitsotakis had voted in favour of it.\n\nIn a speech to parliament earlier Thursday, Mitsotakis said the new law means \u201cpeople who have been invisible until now can finally become visible around us, and with them many children can finally find their rightful place.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor every democratic citizen, today is a day of celebration because starting tomorrow, another barrier will be lifted,\u201d Mitsotakis added.\n\nGreece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis speaks during a debate in parliament on same-sex marriage in Athens, Greece, on Feb. 15, 2024. Michael Varaklas via Associated Press\n\nMost polls ahead of the vote showed the public was split on the issue of legalizing same-sex marriage, but a majority opposed affording adoption rights to gay couples, according to The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the issue of equality in marriage was one of Mitsotakis\u2019 campaign pledges ahead of the general election last summer. Mitsotakis secured a second-term with an absolute majority after winning in a landslide and coming ahead of Syriza by over 20 percentage points.\n\nDespite the fact that Thursday\u2019s vote only concerns civil unions, the church has mounted a campaign against it, making inflammatory statements and warning that it has the potential to jeopardise the traditional family model. The church had previously also opposed civil unions for heterosexual couples.\n\nProtesters participate in a rally against same-sex marriage, at central Syntagma Square, in Athens, Greece, on Feb. 11, 2024. Yorgos Karahalis via Associated Press\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s vote, Greece is the 16th country in the 27-member European Union to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\nSome have speculated that taking up the bill is part of a political calculation by Mitsotakis that it would help alleviate international concerns about a spyware scandal and press freedom, according to Politico Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year, Stefanos Kasselakis became the first openly gay person to be elected party leader in the country after former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras stepped down from the leadership of Syriza. Kasselakis married his partner in New York in October prior to the passage of this new law.",

    "text": "SEAN GLADWELL via Getty Images Reporting junk mail can help reduce spam overall.\n\nWhen you open up your inbox, you may have a few emails that you actually need to address \u2015 along with dozens of spam and junk messages that you did not ask or want to receive. Maybe your texts are flooded with them, too. According to a report from the spam blocking company RoboKiller, people received more than 47 billion spam texts in 2021.\n\nSpam messages can be a distracting nuisance to see, but instead of simply deleting or ignoring these advertisements for surprise lottery winnings or sketchy business proposals, you should consider going one step further: reporting them as junk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s because every time you report a message as junk or spam, it teaches your email or phone provider what spam looks like. And in the long run, that will help reduce the spam that ends up reaching you. As Gmail notes on its help centre guide: \u201cAs you report more spam, Gmail identifies similar emails as spam more efficiently.\u201d\n\nWhen you report something as spam or junk, your messaging system will review the sender, subject and text, said Pierre-Martin Tardif, member of the IT professional organisation ISACA and a professor at Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke in Quebec.\n\nIf you and other users report multiple spam messages from the same address, your mailing system may even block all mail or texts from that sender, he said. With enough spam reports, certain addresses can end up banned as a result.\n\n\u201cIf the sender\u2019s email system sends a tons of junk mail or spam, it can be added to a blacklist, preventing the sender\u2019s email system from sending email to other systems,\u201d Tardif said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can check if your own domain or IP address got blacklisted by checking MxToolbox, a free online blacklist check tool.\n\nHow to report spam messages\n\nMost email services, such as Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo, as well as phone operating systems will include an option to mark messages as junk or report them as spam.\n\nOn Gmail: You select an email after opening the app. Then at the top bar of your inbox, you click the exclamation point that will report spam.\n\nOn iPhones: When you use iMessage, you can report spam or junk messages to Apple in two ways. If you do not want to open the message, you can swipe left, tap the trash can icon, then select Delete and Report Junk. If you already did open the message, a Report Junk link will appear at the bottom if the message was from an unknown sender. From there, you select that link.\n\nOn Android phones: You would tap and hold the conversation you want to report as junk. Then you would tap Block, then Report Spam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpam messages can also be part of scams to gain access to your information and assets. Under such a scam, the bad actor will urge you to take action right away so you do not have time to think through what is being asked of you. Buy yourself a little more time to think by turning on your phone service\u2019s built-in spam filters. Here\u2019s how:\n\nOn iPhones: Go to Settings, then Messages. From there scroll until you see the option for Filter Unknown Senders and tap on that option. That way, any message from an unknown sender gets filtered to another folder you will not be notified about.\n\nOn Android: Go to your Messages app, click on the three-dots icon in the upper right corner, then select Enable Spam Protection.\n\nGetting spam is not just annoying \u2015 in worst case scenarios, it can also be the reason why you lose money.\n\nAmericans lost $330 million from phishing text scams in 2022, with a median loss of $1,000, according to the the Federal Trade Commission. By impersonating bank representatives, delivery services and other businesses in texts and emails, these phishing scammers can get you to give up important personal information. That\u2019s why it helps to stay wary if anyone you don\u2019t know is claiming you need to click a link to pay a \u201credelivery fee\u201d or claim a prize.\n\nAdvertisement",

Being 6\u20320\u201d, I\u2019m always on edge on dates because I\u2019m just waiting for the moment where someone comments on my height in a way that makes me want to evaporate. One time, I was on a date and before the appetisers even came out, he said \u2019You may be 6\u20320 standing up, but i\u2019m 6\u20320 laying down.\u2032 I immediately said, \u2018Check please!\u2019\u201d \u2015 Jasmine Burton, a lawyer and stand-up comedian\n\nThe one with the racist\n\n\u201cShe said the n-word.\u201d \u2015 Simon Fraser, a standup comedian\n\nThe one with the garbage intellectual\n\n\u201cHalfway through a date, he turned to me and said, \u2018I hope you know that this is more of a meeting of the minds\u2019 and proceeded to let me know I could order anything from the Happy Hour menu. After he left, the bar owner came over and told me he heard the whole thing about \u2018meeting of the minds\u2019 and told me to call up two friends and he would pick up our tab for the rest of the night. So it ended up being a pretty great date... without my date!\u201d \u2015 Yue Xu, the co-host and creator of the podcast \u201cDateable\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe one with the man who loves mess\n\n\u201cWithin the first 10 minutes, my date said, \u2018I have a restraining order against my ex-wife, but she\u2019s still my best friend and the love of my life.\u2019 That just sounded like he was already in several complicated relationships, and that I should go. But, it was my first time going to eat at Lemonade, and I enjoyed that!\u201d \u2015 Jones\n\nThe one with the mom\n\n\u201cOnce a girl\u2019s mom showed up in the middle of the date. They both talked about a wedding they had to go to, ordered food, ate and left together.\u201d \u2015 Mohtasham Yaqub, a stand-up comedian\n\neyecrave productions via Getty Images Ideally, don't bring your mom on your first date.\n\nThe one with the orgasm king\n\n\u201cI was running a bit behind to the date so I texted him to let him know and he offered to order me a drink. I arrived to a traditionally handsome finance bro about 10 years my senior, holding a salted rim, spicy margarita. After we cheersed, we locked eyes to take our first sip and just as the liquid was about to hit my lip, he blurted out, loudly, \u2018I can make any woman orgasm.\u2019 No \u2018How was your day?\u2019 Not one \u2018What is your favourite movie?\u2019 Just right out of the gate with orgasming.\n\n\u201cI closed my eyes, pulled the drink away from my mouth, exhaled and said, \u2018OK, curious, what\u2019s the technique?\u2019 To which he said he always enlists the help of a Magic Wand. I set my drink down, told him that he isn\u2019t credited for giving the women an orgasm, the toy was \u2015 and said that some amount of small talk would have been a nice lubrication to that opener. Then I excused myself from that date \u2015 and from future dates \u2015 for many months because, as he said\u2026 all we needed was a little magic, after all.\u201d \u2015 Mara Marek, a comedian and the host of the podcast \u201cIt\u2019s A Maravelous Life\u201d",

    "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nSex therapists are experts in a wide range of bedroom matters. Through talk therapy, they help their clients work through issues like low or mismatched libidos, performance anxiety, sexual shame and an inability to achieve orgasm, to name just a few. They can also help folks explore their sexuality, fantasies, kinks and non-monogamous relationship structures.\n\nBased on their years of professional experience, we asked these sexperts what they personally avoid in the bedroom. Here\u2019s what we learned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would never try something new without a partner\u2019s consent.\n\nOne of sex therapist Tom Murray\u2019s rules is to never experiment in the bedroom without talking to his partner and getting their approval first.\n\n\u201cThe realm of intimate relationships is wide and diverse, providing endless opportunities to discover joy, pleasure and connection. But exploring new ground without consent from both parties may cause unease, betrayals of confidence and even injury,\u201d Murray, author of \u201cMaking Nice With Naughty,\u201d told HuffPost.\n\nHaving conversations about your sexual desires and limits fosters respect, ensures both parties are on the same page and builds anticipation, he said.\n\n\u201cA good sexual relationship depends on this kind of conversation because it ensures that any exploration is grounded in permission and mutual curiosity, strengthening the connection and enhancing the experience for both parties,\u201d Murray added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI would never fake an orgasm.\n\n\u201cOur culture is very \u2018results\u2019 focused, even and especially when it comes to sex. Some of the best sex I\u2019ve had hasn\u2019t included a point of climax for me or my partner,\u201d she told HuffPost.\n\nIn fact, refusing to fake orgasms is a boundary she\u2019s set for herself.\n\n\u201c[It] helps me to centre my experience of pleasure and de-centre the expectation that \u2018good sex\u2019 always has to include an earth-shattering orgasm,\u201d she said. \u201cLess pressure equals more fun.\u201d\n\nDelmaine Donson via Getty Images Sex therapists reveal the bedroom habits they personally avoid.\n\nI don\u2019t police my partner\u2019s sexual fantasies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cVarious factors, such as our environment, stress levels, life stage and childhood experiences, contribute to what arouses us,\u201d Moali said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common for our partners to have fantasies that may not involve us, and for most individuals, having a fantasy doesn\u2019t imply a breach of the relationship agreement. Embracing our unique desires and understanding the complexity of our sexual selves can enhance the intimacy and connection we share.\u201d\n\nI would never shame my partner for what they\u2019re into.\n\nYou won\u2019t find sex therapist Incia A. Rashid of The Expansive Group making rude or otherwise insensitive remarks about something a partner expresses interest in that would make them feel ashamed for opening up.\n\n\u201cIn the sex therapy world, we have a phrase that goes, \u2018Don\u2019t yuck someone else\u2019s yum,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cCausing someone to experience shame will undo their sense of safety. This applies to all aspects of intimacy, such as how a person presents themselves to their partners or suggestions for exploration from their partners.\u201d\n\nRashid has worked with female-identifying clients who are shamed by their partners for \u201cthe littlest things\u201d \u2014 like how they groom their pubic hair or what kind of lingerie they wear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou cannot experience true sexual freedom if you are being shamed,\u201d she said.\n\nNor would I shame myself for letting my mind wander during sex.\n\nAs a sex therapist, Hellstrom doesn\u2019t beat herself up for occasionally engaging in mental fantasies during sex. Being totally in the moment is great, but \u201cit\u2019s also completely normal for the mind to wander when we\u2019re in the transcendental space of the erotic,\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIf my mind starts down a path of remembering past moments or fantasising about new scenarios during sex, I allow my mind to journey down those paths without judgment,\u201d Hellstrom said. \u201cThis also allows me to gently return my attention to the present moment when I\u2019m ready to do so. Less shame equals more fun!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t blame myself for a partner\u2019s erection issues.\n\nMoali doesn\u2019t assume that her partner\u2019s erectile issues are her fault unless that has been communicated to her. Often people take these bedroom issues personally, which only worsens the situation, when really it could be a result of stress, sleep disturbances, a physiological issue or other causes.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t reflect on someone\u2019s attractiveness or chemistry if your partner is facing challenges; it could simply be a result of a bad night\u2019s sleep,\u201d Moali explained. \u201cInstead of pulling away or ignoring the issue, a better approach is to ask them, \u2018How can I support you right now?\u2019 Let\u2019s foster a supportive environment!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t avoid uncomfortable conversations about sex.\n\nSex therapist Janet Brito, founder of The Sexual Health School, told HuffPost that she prioritises emotional intimacy and open communication about sexual preferences in the bedroom. Sure, these conversations aren\u2019t always easy to have, but they\u2019re integral to a satisfying sex life.\n\nAdvertisement",

    "text": "Photo: Rigger Dylan Gong \"I decided that if there wasn\u2019t a space for Asian kinksters to feel at home, then I\u2019d create my own,\" says author Fei Lu.\n\nMy coming out as a kink enthusiast began with an Instagram post: a video of me, tied shibari style, struggling with my constraints. It was a raw, unfiltered and gently pornographic expression of my BDSM lifestyle.\n\nThe reaction was mixed \u2014 I got admiration, shock and even suggestions on how to monetise the video. It might have seemed like a reckless unveiling to my peers and family, especially as an Ivy League-trained Chinese American journalist who spent her 20s fighting for a career in a notoriously competitive industry. \u201cWhy would a woman with so much privilege risk her reputation for this?\u201d some of them wondered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s because I was tired. I\u2019d spent my 20s curating and maintaining a facade of the type of \u201cperfection\u201d that kept me in a constant state of anxiety. I was determined to start my 30s with a new type of confidence. If I can\u2019t have fun now, then when?\n\nThat video changed my life. It was my \u201cfuck you\u201d to the unspoken rules imposed on Asian American women \u2014 to conform and remain palatable, especially to the white gaze. Coming out as a kinkster was also my rebellion against the \u201cmodel minority\u201d myth that I remain a quiet, harmless and conventional Chinese girl. Tired of keeping my head down, I wanted to exercise my expression of ethnicity, queerness and kink unapologetically.\n\nRiding the high of self-celebration, I launched a media consulting agency for the adult industry and shared more free BDSM content online. I didn\u2019t intend to become an adult performer; I just wanted to celebrate the body I\u2019d worked so hard for with the world because, for the first time in my life, I felt genuinely beautiful, powerful and sexy. And with that newfound perspective, I began organising kink events centring the Asian American and Pacific Islander community.\n\nIn the past, I found most kink and play parties through word-of-mouth advertising, friend referrals and Instagram. Many promoters championed these events as diverse havens for progressive sexual exploration among people of all sexualities, ethnicities and genders. To my disappointment, however, my experiences in supposedly \u201cdiverse\u201d kink spaces were often isolating and demoralising. I was frequently one of the few Asian people in the space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI experienced interactions that ranged from disrespectful and racist under-the-breath remarks to being handled as an exotic novelty by non-Asian attendees. They\u2019d often reduce me to antiquated stereotypes (if one more white person asks if I\u2019ve watched \u201cKill Bill,\u201d I will scream) or a vehicle in which to fulfil their fantasies. And when they learned that I lean submissive in most of my BDSM dynamics, it got even worse.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter if these were private house parties or large-scale kink parties; the vibe was always the same. My acceptance as an Asian woman was conditional \u2014 either I be the walking fetish for white people, or I erase my Asianness and assimilate.\n\nAnd so I decided that if there wasn\u2019t a space for Asian kinksters to feel at home, then I\u2019d create my own: a space where we can be our genuine kinky, deviant and fabulous selves. Together, we\u2019d explore our sexuality without the constraint of stereotypes or the oppressive gaze from outside the community. My ultimate aim was to build intentional spaces where our racial and sexual identities are openly celebrated and respected. It\u2019s about reclaiming our sexuality by tearing down the submissive stereotype forcibly imposed on Asian women.\n\nThe first event I threw, in the fall of last year, was called \u201cFever\u201d \u2014 a cheeky nod to the racial fetish \u201cyellow fever,\u201d which refers to non-Asian people who fetishise Asians. The subversiveness was empowering to me, and I was inspired by the way other marginalised groups reclaimed words that were traditionally associated with racism, homophobia and sexism.\n\nPhoto: Author, Fei Lu \"My coming out as a kink enthusiast began with an Instagram post: a video of me, tied shibari style, struggling with my constraints,\" the author says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, when I think of the word \u201cfever,\u201d I imagine a rising body heat that permeates every inch of me, filling my mind with delirious hazes and dreams that can be mesmerisingly otherworldly \u2014 and that\u2019s what I wanted this event to embody. I\u2019d feature Asian performers, partner with AAPI-owned businesses, and play music from all over the diaspora. I\u2019d create an experience so undeniably ours that it\u2019d keep racists far away. And of course, I\u2019d invite as many AAPI kinksters as I could.\n\nAnd it came to fruition. We had a live shibari demonstration and a burlesque performance, too. Afterward, I got Instagram messages filled with joy and gratitude that moved me to keep going, even though it was challenging. To facilitate these events, I tapped into my savings to make sure my performers were paid and I could run ads on social media.\n\nPhoto: Sidewalkkilla Hellgirl Agency creative director Dylan Gong and the author at the \"Fever\" event.\n\nMy real friends and community members are continually instrumental to the cause, volunteering their time and resources to support my endeavour. I\u2019ll eventually (hopefully) make some profit from throwing these parties, but for now I\u2019m fuelled by the rush of knowing that I made some Asian kinksters in New York City feel welcome in a normally exclusionary community.\n\nIn the future, I envision rooms packed to the brim with Asian kinksters of all ethnicities, backgrounds, nationalities, sexualities and, of course, kinks. I want Asian Americans mingling with Asian expats and lifestyle kinksters mingling with professional doms and dominatrixes \u2014 everyone being able to fully share their interests without some creep coming up and saying \u201cmy ex-girlfriend was Asian too\u201d or \u201cI just love Asians.\u201d In my new world, those people can kindly fuck off.\n\nAdvertisement",

And it was like, not mid-scene, but it was while we were supposed to be working and it kind of all just fell flat.\u201d\n\nThankfully, Ambika\u2019s first memory of the \u201ccheeky and charming\u201d Leo are more flattering.\n\n\u201cHe was so open and warm just immediately and it felt really easy,\u201d she told the podcast Reign. \u201cThe scenes felt really playful and I think that\u2019s really rare.\u201d\n\nStill, Ambika wasn\u2019t sure about the role \u2013 and initially turned it down\n\nIn fact, she told Vogue she initially didn\u2019t even want to audition for the part at all.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that I was right for the part,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I would be wasting everyone\u2019s time if I even taped for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThen I just woke up in bed one night and I was like, \u2018I\u2019ve made a massive mistake\u2019. I called my agent the next morning and I was like, \u2019Is it too late to tape?.\u201d\n\nAmbika Mod and Leo Woodall at a screening of One Day last week Anthony Harvey/Shutterstock for Netflix\n\nCasting for the roles of Emma and Dexter were open to actors of all ethnicities\n\nAmbika told the Watford Observer: \u201cWhen they were auditioning it was colourblind.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t looking for a particular race or ethnicity, they were just looking for the best person to play her, and I\u2019m very lucky and very thankful that they thought that was me.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cBefore we started filming, we talked about my race and my ethnicity and what that might mean for Emma.\n\n\u201cBut it never really impeded or explicitly showed itself in the writing or in the series in any way because it\u2019s not a story about a young brown woman \u2014 it\u2019s a story about two people, Emma and Dexter, and their love, their friendship and their growing up.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeo was filming The White Lotus when he auditioned \u2013 leading to an unfortunate mix-up early on in the casting process\n\n\u201cI flew back to London to do my first in person meeting and I had forgotten to take off my neck tattoo,\u201d Leo told Lorraine Kelly.\n\nHe later told Virgin Radio: \u201cThey all panicked, because they thought it real.\u201d\n\nLeo in The White Lotus HBO\n\nAfter being cast in the roles, it was a pretty quick turnaround for Ambika and Leo\n\nIn fact, Ambika told HuffPost UK there \u201cwasn\u2019t time\u201d for herself and Leo to grow their off-screen bond before filming began.\n\n\u201cWe met for a gin and tonic before we started pre-production,\u201d Leo said. \u201cOn the Southbank to just have a chat. But that was it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmbika added: \u201cI\u2019d just finished a job, [Leo] had just finished a job, we went straight into rehearsals, so you just have to [build that chemistry] in real time.\u201d\n\nThe two leads also had a different approach to the original One Day book and its divisive 2011 film adaptation\n\nAmbika read One Day as a teenager, and immediately fell in love with it, but told HuffPost UK that she avoided rewatching the first on-screen version, in case it \u201cthrew me\u201d.\n\nHowever, Leo had never read the book when he auditioned, so watched the film as part of his research.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you might expect, Ambika had Anne Hathaway on her mind when it came to preparing for the role\n\nOne major criticism of the 2011 film One Day was Anne Hathaway\u2019s attempts at a Yorkshire accent, which made Hertfordshire-born Ambika all the more determined to really nail it.\n\n\u201cWe were militant,\u201d she told us, of her work with dialect coach Natalie Grady. \u201cWe met, like, three times a week, hour-and-a-half sessions, we went through every single sound.\n\n\u201cI learned a really, really strong, authentic Leeds accent, and then we pared it down and found an accent that felt really truthful to Emma and where she was in episode one, and then we tapered it from then on.\u201d\n\nAnne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in their version of One Day Moviestore/Shutterstock\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthor David Nicholls has said there\u2019s one key difference between the TV show and his original book\n\n\u201cThere is a lot more sex in this than there is in the novel,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cI tend to fade to black and Nicole [Taylor, One Day\u2019s head writer] doesn\u2019t fade to black.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOf course we\u2019ve cut things. We\u2019ve had to condense things. So there\u2019s still those editorial decisions to be made, but I\u2019ve been so happy with the process and it\u2019s been an incredibly enjoyable experience.\u201d\n\nAmbika Mod and Leo Woodall in the first episode of One Day Netflixo\n\nIntimacy co-ordinators also worked closely with the cast to help convey the pair\u2019s complicated relationship\n\nAmbika told Vogue: \u201cWe all sat down and had a really in-depth discussion about the relationship, about what the intimacy in that relationship would look like, about how it evolves, how it differs from the intimacy in other relationships.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never thought about sex and intimacy in that way before, but it was so revealing and so helpful.\u201d\n\nAs for that devastating ending, the pair were lucky in that they \u2018got it out of the way\u2019 pretty early on\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s weird is we filmed the last episode at the beginning of the series,\u201d Ambika told HuffPost UK. \u201cSo actually, after we let go of that, it just kind of felt like a great time.\u201d\n\nLeo also noted that there were times he and Ambika were even able to \u201ckind of forget\u201d the way the story turns out, to which she agreed: \u201cYou just get it out of the way, and then you can kind of focus on the good times.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very first scene the pair shot together was a bit earlier on in the story, though\n\nDay one of shooting was the sequence in episode three, where Emma and Dexter have both moved to London and share a drink in Camden Town park.\n\nAs Netflix\u2019s companion publication Tudum put it: \u201cWith the beautiful golden hour light, the stunning backdrop perfectly juxtaposed Emma\u2019s disappointment in her lackluster London life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really helps bring home how important Dexter is in making her feel like she belongs to something in the city,\u201d director Molly Manners added.\n\nAmbika Mod and Leo Woodall in the first scene they shot together Teddy Cavendish/Netflix\n\nThe real Arthur\u2019s Seat in Edinburgh was used in those early sequences \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t exactly the best experience for Leo\n\n\u201cThe weather was gorgeous. For me, a highlight was Arthur\u2019s Seat,\u201d Ambika told Rolling Stone. \u201cEspecially that that first day up there, that was a week into the shoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a slightly different experience on Arthur\u2019s Seat,\u201d Leo then admitted. \u201cI got food poisoning, I think I\u2019d had some dodgy pork! It was really windy and I was really not feeling OK.\u201d\n\nLeo later recalled to Bafta: \u201cThe second day was less fun for me, because I got food poisoning right as we hit the top of the huge, huge hill. And we had to just keep filming, it didn\u2019t matter what state I was in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was far to fall after the first day,\u201d Ambika joked.\n\nLeo and Ambika filming in Edinburgh for the first episode of One Day Netflix\n\nThe location actually held a place in Ambika\u2019s heart\n\nAs well as her acting work, Ambika is a comedy writer and improv comic.\n\nDuring an appearance on Graham Norton, she revealed she\u2019d been feeling \u201ca bit lost\u201d, \u201cquite depressed\u201d and like she \u201cwasn\u2019t getting anywhere\u201d after a run at the city\u2019s iconic Fringe festival in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOn the last day of the Fringe, we climbed Arthur\u2019s Seat and I remember it as a terrible time. I was not loving myself or my life,\u201d she admitted.\n\n\u201cThen cut to almost exactly three years later and I am filming in Edinburgh at Arthur\u2019s Seat playing the lead in a Netflix series of my favourite book. It felt very special. A full circle moment.\u201d\n\nAnother of the show\u2019s locations was used in another Netflix hit\n\nFor the scenes at Sylvie\u2019s family home, the show took up residence at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, which was previously used as a set in the Bridgerton prequel Queen Charlotte.\n\nIncidentally, Hatfield, Hertfordshire happens to be the town where Ambika was born.\n\nBecause Ambika and Leo weren\u2019t actually born for most of the period One Day is set in, they ran into a few problems on set\n\n\u201cThere was a lot to learn,\u201d Ambika told Bafta. \u201cWe had to be taught how to use phones, desktop computers, payphones, typewriters\u2026 because we just didn\u2019t [know]! We were like, \u2018what do we do with this?\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd we had to be taught \u2013 usually by an older member of the crew who would begrudgingly give us instructions.\u201d\n\nUsing older tech didn't exactly come easy to the show's young cast Netflix\n\nThe show also takes place entirely in the month of July, which presented problems of its own\n\n\u201cWe did Paris but that was at the end of January and everyone was tired and cold,\u201d Leo told Rolling Stone. \u201cWe were still pretending it was 15 July \u2013 and we were in limited clothing.\u201d\n\nAmbika continued: \u201cFrom November onwards is when things started to get really tricky because we were outside with no clothes on, having to look like it was a nice warm summer\u2019s evening, which was its own challenge that I didn\u2019t think either of us could have foreseen going into this.\n\n\u201cHaving watched it back, I\u2019m very proud of us, you wouldn\u2019t have been able to guess!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were points where we had to almost hold our breath to stop frosty breath coming out,\u201d Leo then added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdverse weather was apparently a bit of a recurring theme\n\nAccording to Time Out, some on-screen magic was used to make Dexter look older for his second venture to Arthur\u2019s Seat, which proved problematic when high-force winds came into effect.",
